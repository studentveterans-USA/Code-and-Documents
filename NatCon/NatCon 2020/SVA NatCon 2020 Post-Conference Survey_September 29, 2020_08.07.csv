In reality, their service doesn't seem to be very useful, and may also distract from local SVA chapters. I did some math, and I was confused as to how this was non-for-profit. They claimed to have given $8000 in awards last year, but when you crunch the numbers... $35 lifetime membership multiplied by 18,000 members = $630,000 in membership fees alone. That's almost 79 years of awards if they give $8000 a year. That membership fee also doesn't include graduation regalia or the one time $150 payment from the school to start a chapter... so you have to pay extra for it, adding onto their funds. The membership comes with a recommendation letter from someone who doesn't even know you, and the requirement for the honor society is only a 3.0, which doesn't make it competitive. Their scholarships are great, but small enough to where it's going to be offset by what you lose in financial aid every year.

I know Dr. Lynda Davis was not able to make it in the end but I have seen her speak before and I hope you bring her next year.  I know for political reasons VFW & American Legion have to speak, and they spoke way less which was good but please try & convince them to have the speaker be under the age of 40, especially given the audience they are speaking to.  

I really enjoyed the diversity of the speakers you had and the topics they covered.  I got a lot out of this year's conference.  I went to a number of impressive breakout sessions that covered a range of topics, especially diversity.  I have been to multiple conferences/sessions addressing Veterans & diversity and I found Linda Hinkle's presentation on Women Veterans to be the best presentation of the conference and just outstanding.  We are planning on bringing her to our campus in March.  Bring her back next year to SVA!!!   ","Keep the keynotes to a shorter length.  Friday night with Ron Meyer & Jared Lyon was great.  Saturday went on way too long.  Kirstie Ennis and Deshauna Barber were great but most of the other speakers just killed the energy in the room & went on way too long.  By the time Lida got up to speak, the crowd had significantly dispersed or was not really paying attention.  The banquet was way better paced but 3.5 hours is a long time and i think could be made to flow just a little better/faster.  

SVA is doing a much better job of highlighting diversity and inclusion in your speakers, presentations, etc.  Keep it up!  The next area that I would recommend that gets addressed/highlighted would be around parenting student veterans and the unique challenges that added identity brings.  

I have very high expectations and standards for what I want from a conference and I commend SVA for all the improvements and willingness to continue to strive to be better.  ",6209053,1,School Employee

Loved the workout sessions in the mornings as well. The general sessions were also really fun to watch. The only reason I missed the Saturday, was because I was networking down stairs. 

Honestly, the only thing that made it worse than last year was the location. ODU brought 13 people, which was 5 more than the previous year. However, I had more buy in at Orlando. It was honestly due to the outside distractions. Last year we had the nights to explore all of the parks if we wanted too. LA however, there is too much to see. I had people late in the mornings because of the clubs in LA. I had people not utilizing the campus because they wanted to see the ocean or the Hollywood sign more. There attitude was that, well we can always network later. The smog also made a lot of people sick after we got home.

I was pleased that the topic was getting attention and thought the information was great but it's really all at an O level. I would say it was more descriptive than prescriptive. The ladder is what I'd hoped for. I also think that there was a missed opportunity in expressing why this is important. Most schools are actively pushing diversity and trying to moving away from toxic masculine cultures. Being inclusive is not only decent and shows appreciation for people who served, but it's the way forward.

I wanted to know how best to help support and ally with female veterans. Great session. Topics like this  are what are going to drive veterans clubs into being thriving entities on campus rather than struggling  groups in the shadows. Having a diverse veterans group is also engaging and beneficial to the country as a whole. Changing the image in the public discourse is the best kind of PR for the military and veterans. Most of the kids they meet in college will have very limited engagement with veterans in the future, so it's critical to to make that bridge and allow other people to see themselves in veteran communities. Last time I checked 51% of the country was female, so maybe it would be a good idea to honor women's service more than appears to be the current norm. For the record I am not female, but thank you so much for putting this on. I think its so much more important that another talk about the mechanics of the SVA.

I am not a full vegetarian (it's too impractical for me) but I eat vegetarian unless there is a specific reason not to. So being offered a wholly inadequate chunk of meat for dinner was doubly insulting. I sound like I'm mostly mad about the food, but thats less than half of it. I stopped attending your talks/keynotes after the first day for my own sanity. They were long, rambling, and poorly targeted. You should include your keynote and speakers in the itinerary so that people can pick an choose. I would have loved to have listened to the female door gunner talk, but I was too burnt out on every other speaker so I never knew and didn't attend the session. This was my first natcon and if I come back I have every intention of skipping every keynote/speaker unless you publish an itinerary so I can cherry pick. 

Back to food. Generally you did a decent job of offering veggie options, but the bar is so low you could still improve with just a little effort. Your veggie options had vegatables (low caloric value) and lots of simple carbs (low nutritional value). The easiest way around this is to offer dishes with eggs, beans(legumes), or tofu. Seriously if you just stuck some hard boiled eggs at the end of the line for every meal I would have been thrilled. Thats how low the bar is. If you had any sort of ambitions you could make bean salads or even just straight beans (not cooked meat) available.

Not having general seating available for the Awards banquet was a huge downer. Some of my fellow students weren't able to sit with us or even attend, which caused the majority of my school to go out to a restaurant instead of participating. 

I'd rather there wasn't entertainment at the banquet. Get straight to the awards. If you feel you need entertainment have Simon Sinek or a keynote present on something more applicable to everyone.

","My first conference was in Orlando, FL 2019, and it was an incredible and enlightening opportunity that I will never forget and it has truly changed my life. However, the experience in LA this year was not that effect. Please for future conference, find locations that will cater to the attendees for subliminal costs; i.e., shuttle services, discounts, restaurant recommendations, etc. Lastly, the conference ""swag"" was poor this year. Nothing was provided to the attendees to remember the exclusiveness of NatCon 2020 to bring in the new year unlike the experience of Orlando 2019. NatCon 2020, like the new decade should of been the biggest and best experience that could have been provided, and it did not feel as such.

One improvement is the ""moment of silence for our country"" by the singer. WTF? 
Without overtly stating anti Trump stance, the message was clear. Seems to me the entertainment  and thus the SVA choice in the matter was not very patriotic. 

Fact is, that day or the day prior, the POTUS issued an order that challenged Tehran for the first time in generations. The result was a diplomatic success, they backed down. While civilian entertainers and civilians in general usually  dont understand patriotism or the sacrifice made on their behalf, as the SVA I found it in poor taste to have him up there and do that. I walked out at that moment.

What's next, an entertainer that uses our venue to take a knee during the National Anthem? 

Overall, the general impression I got of the event was not apolitical, but left leaning. Simon Sinek, while a great speaker mentioned more ""female style leadership"" in men an overt nod to the female supremacy political ideology and a slap in the face to the overwhelimg majority of military males past, present , and future. More typical male bashing as if we dont get enough of that in the media everyday. Not to beat a dead horse, but this comment was right in line with former President Obama's comment that the world would be better with more female leaders. 
The breakout session on transgenderism, less than 0.1 % of the force, and which is a mental disorder called gender dysphoria according to the American Psychiatric Association not something to be celebrated and given it's own entire block of instruction. 

The focus on women injured vet. Ok, got it. She sacrificed tremendously. She's one female who did, when many of thousands more men did as well. Why have her speak and not MOH recipient Kyle White.

For my all my issues, I do have some solutions. Overall I'd say start with changing the lense, the world view in which you start as planners of the event.  Our country is winning in virtually every measure. Why not abandon the left leaning, female empowering, world citizen perspective and get back to American patriotism and exceptionalism.  It's not PC, got it, and neither are we as veterans for the most part. Most of us are overwhelmingly conservative and if you want to represent us, then God bless it, you should be too, and plan our events accordingly. I understand  you guys work in DC and the town is very anti trump and anti American overall, but so what, dont put a guy who has us take a ""moment of silence for our country"" at a time when we as veterans should be throwing a  damn parade. Not at our event. Not on our night. Save that BS for Congress.

It is my hope that by expressing this concern it will change the future conferences for those of us interested in  medicine.  You have all the corporate attendees seeking us out with job opportunities.  Where is the medical side? At many Veteran events that speak of opportunities in college and the job they always leave us out of healthcare.  As a Veteran who is studying to one day go to PA school I would have like to see opportunities to get direct patient care hours from hospitals or colleges that have these hospitals.  But I didn't see that opportunity.  I get that each year this grows and this is an area that has limitations due to the increasing need and cohort support for doctors, nurses, and PAs.  However, many medical students these days go to medical school and don't follow through afterwards in the medical field.  It has been proven that as Veterans we follow through for the most part. So why is it that we are not marketable when we are truly the best candidates? I would like to see agendas in the future with breakout sessions on how we can serve in healthcare more.  Maybe partnering with Service to Schools and Warrior Scholar Project to create the missing opportunities in the medical part of STEM that we are clearly being left out of.

I am currently awaiting a global internship in Cape Town, South Africa with hopes to serve in a orthopedic hospital for the summer.  I have already been chosen for the Benjamin Gilman Scholarship and am awaiting 2 others.  I believe an opportunity like this would set me apart for a future in a PA program and afterwards.  I also believe that many of us think our travel days are over when we return to school when it can truly be just the beginning.  I think this should be a breakout session option as well on how we can travel while going to college and how to fund it through scholarships.  As many of these scholarships for study abroad truly do want Veterans to apply and do give us preference because of our history of service and foreign relations while serving.  It also stands out to employers that we can work or study in our transition outside of the uniform and bridge the international gap that their business may need.  As a study abroad Ambassador, I am well versed in the countless benefits these experiences bring to our population and others.

Thank you for the great job.  I was impressed with everything that was available for the most part.  And I will encourage more student Veterans to go while supporting SVA chapters in the future on campus I should transfer to.  Thank you for your service to our community.

And if there is a way to find companies that tailor to majors that might not usually have a company there for example social workers there are many areas that social workers can go into but there might not be a company that are looking for them the SVA campus is amazing but most companies there are tailored to look for majors that are STEM related and the the companies there would be tailored to them for the most part by expanding the campus area if possible those majors that would usually might not find a opportunity with a company would have the chance to network for once.

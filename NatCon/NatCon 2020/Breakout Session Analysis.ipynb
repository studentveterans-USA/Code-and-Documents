They claimed to have given $8000 in awards last year, but when you crunch the numbers... $35 lifetime membership multiplied by 18,000 members = $630,000 in membership fees alone. That\\'s almost 79 years of awards if they give $8000 a year. That membership fee also doesn\\'t include graduation regalia or the one time $150 payment from the school to start a chapter... so you have to pay extra for it, adding onto their funds. The membership comes with a recommendation letter from someone who doesn\\'t even know you, and the requirement for the honor society is only a 3.0, which doesn\\'t make it competitive. Their scholarships are great, but small enough to where it\\'s going to be offset by what you lose in financial aid every year.

It was disappointing that between scheduled food breaks there was no way to get coffee or snacks.\\n* The presense of VAB was amazing and extremely helpful.

This was a great idea and there was no \"cattle rush\" for seats which was a huge improvement.\\n\\nThings that were off:\\n* Every year that I have attended SVA NATCON, I left feeling empowered and inspired.

The only reason I missed the Saturday, was because I was networking down stairs. \\n\\nHonestly, the only thing that made it worse than last year was the location. ODU brought 13 people, which was 5 more than the previous year. However, I had more buy in at Orlando. It was honestly due to the outside distractions. Last year we had the nights to explore all of the parks if we wanted too. LA however, there is too much to see. I had people late in the mornings because of the clubs in LA. I had people not utilizing the campus because they wanted to see the ocean or the Hollywood sign more. There attitude was that, well we can always network later. The smog also made a lot of people sick after we got home. I like the idea of having it California, and it makes sense to switch back and forth so that its fair across the board. Maybe in Anaheim in 2021? Also, I do know the Texas schools were looking forward to something closer to them, like in 2018. I think Austin would be a great choice. \",\n",

       " 'The lack of experience on the part of the organizers continues.  There is too much \"going through the motions\" without learning from past deficits.  The indifference to the composition of panels, i.e., failure to distinguish whether they are qualified, prepared, or experienced is a serious flaw. There seems to be a significant neglect of ALL student veteran communities/environments which results an event skewed to too small a segment of the student veteran population. This detracts from the relevance and importance of attending.  Seek some outside consultation from other organizations beyond corporate offerings.  Attendees are students, not a sales force or commercial vendors.  On a lesser note, the seating and food offered was odd, if not underwhelming. ',\n",

The lack of food and seating during refreshment breaks was disappointing as well as breakfast/lunch/dinner not being offered throughout the conference. I was disappointed that shirts were not given out this year. Finally, I was disappointed that all the \"high profile\" or advertised guest speakers were all done on one day. I had to leave early to attend class on Monday, so that is my issue, but I would recommend spreading the guest speakers out throughout the conference instead of having them all on one day or the last day. I felt that a lot of the focus was on bringing these high profile/notable/famous individuals to the conference to speak and not on the actual purpose of the conference, student veterans. ',\n",

I also tried during a lunch hour but the doors to the campus were closed as vendors were also trying to get a chance to eat. \\n\\nNot having general seating available for the Awards banquet was a huge downer. Some of my fellow students weren't able to sit with us or even attend, which caused the majority of my school to go out to a restaurant instead of participating. \\n\\nI'd rather there wasn't entertainment at the banquet. Get straight to the awards. If you feel you need entertainment have Simon Sinek or a keynote present on something more applicable to everyone. The loud music made my ears ring, and caused a headache.

I can see inviting people to dinner off-site, small meetings within personal rooms, or reserving a special space within the conference center for bigger groups.  Or have a coordinator who helps connect people who are feeling adventurous, kind of like a blind date but for networking (4-5pp max).

In LA the Conference center was surrounded by homeless population, high priced restaurants and no avenue of shuttle services outside personal means of a cab, lyft, or uber. The Orlando conference was my first SVA conference and everything was taken care of and as an attendee, the hotel staff and management made the priority on the health and well-being of staying at their location. I cannot say that for the experience in LA. ',\n",

I graduate this May and I was using this conference to help me. It did not. ',\n",

Combined with multiple events and the intensity that is L.A., the convention seemed rushed and hastily developed. Whereas Orlando, events were spaced out laterally, the campus was huge but it gave you a sense of space. The food at LA Live was about 50% of what Orlando had. \\n\\nThe biggest takeaway I witnessed was how many people didn\\'t attend sessions but instead went to LA events. It\\'s unfortunate that when a group of veterans gets together like this, it only takes one shiny object to pull us away. Obviously, I don\\'t speak for everyone, but one of the advantages of the Orlando campus was that it was so far away from anything \"downtown\". ',\n",

Pros to the virtual conference, schools and students do not have to pay travel and hotel fees. Also, the weather during this time of year is so unpredictable. Everyone can enjoy gathering from the comfort of their own homes. Virtual NATCON allows flexibility for students as well. I know many of us have to leave events to work on homework.

I could not engage fast enough at times or find the conversation later to ask questions or say hello. The chat features within the events made a world of difference. I was able to ask questions without worrying about overstepping another veteran. This feature gave the panelists the opportunity to collectively address questions thus saving time to answer others.

There were none to be had this year at NatCon.","There was almost no valuable correspondence before the event - all hype, no substance. Exhibitors were holding individual info sessions, yet there was no information about those - many of which sounded significantly more interesting than the breakout topics. The exhibitor booths were not ""manned,"" instead you had to go through some weird portal to get to them. The diversity of exhibitors was garbage. I met far more grad students than undergrads, yet there was nothing for grad students except MSW students. I also exhausted by VA Education benefits a long time ago; there was nothing for people like me. The ""My Agenda"" feature allowed me to add events then not be able to access them later - it was completely worthless.

To be completely honest, if I had paid for this, I would be pissed. I will never attend another NatCon, nor will I recommend it to our chapter's members. The whole thing felt like a fun-fair for immature veterans who lack initiative to self-advocate. One of the sessions I attended was basically a bitch session for children who felt the need to complain about everything yet do nothing to advance their own position; it was a ""what handouts do you have for me"" session. Many of the chat rooms were dick-measuring contests, designed more for those with well-functioning chapters to flex on others than for real networking, collaboration, or advice. I am a chapter leader, and I just disengaged after having some fuckwad leader of another chapter dismiss a couple of us with struggling chapters. We apparently weren't at her level, so we were trash. That attitude is toxic and further tainted my opinion of the whole event. SVA does not provide anything of value to me or anyone I know. Stick to advocating in DC; that is where you actually provide a service."

Now that I think about it, just having a regional happy hour in person kind of would be pretty cool too. Not sure how feasible it would be but it's an idea.

Also, I have a medical degree and there weren't really a lot of medical companies that I could speak to. I think there was maybe one and they didn't really make it easy to contact them. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to figure it out but it didn't seem like it was easy. Maybe even getting in contact with like medical device companies would be really cool.

Also I am a little creative and I do have a side gig that's on the creative and artsy side and maybe having a section or a way to connect other artistically inclined veterans would be kind of cool. There aren't many of us so there wasn't a lot aimed at artistically inclined veterans.

And lastly: JamCon2022. Bring your guitar, Jared. Let's have some really cool SVA karaoke nights! (JamCon is a joint idea thought into existence by myself and Kevin Jenkins. I can't take full credit.)"

We are adults that have experienced more than high school and freshman year of college. "

The platform was a delight to navigate.
1)Please support older Student veterans... yes I dont doubt that 24 year old students starting a Bachelors need support... but what about the 4040-something student starting their second career?
2) How about a grad school lounge?  There's just different stuff you're up against than your first 4-year degree.
3a) Please shut down chat displayed on the main stage when people like the 1st Lady is speaking. Yes, she doesnt know its on.  Im beside myself, ""how rude"", I want to think that preferences of cheese flavors, or how they like or dont like soneone or something, or self-marketing was not going on concurrently. Let chat be a separate resource or selectable ON/OFF, at that time. 
3b) About chat... nice to have... I found my recruiter, from almost 21 years ago... but maybe have it displayed differently on the main page like a pop out whole side column that we can resize?... or make the font smaller to read more, make the volume on/off easy to find, maybe allow us to dim the incoming msgs so they're there but less distracting? 
4) while ""ontime delivery"" for emailed links can be helpful to not lose them... I couldnt prepare ahead to login for the day... Day1 I ended up with some lost time, while I tried to figure it out.
5) I liked that the Breakouts had a presentation, then Q&A... please mute all mics on participant entry, some breakout rooms would have benefited from a tech/moderator to assist (or maybe a more involved one?)
6) I would greatly appreciate another similar event... or spread this to 3 days.  I was not there to get info to manage my SVA, and I might have been in the way of those who were... BUT I was there and made great use of networking with other grad students / alumni, and valuably accessed the employers.  Maybe have a 3rd day that is just employer meetings, maybe a series of breakout rooms in addition to their own chat spaces or separate 1:1 interview options? Maybe bring some more big-names, US agencies... etc. A great place for a USAjobs talk, a great place for presentations about employment and resumes following a Bachelor degree, or differently following a PhD.  

I accessed several agencies and alumn.  Interacting with alumn and actual employers (especially HR/recruiters) is such an important step in a veteran's path when they are stuggling to reinvent and re-title themselves, while trying to navigate civilian constructs.  Just like military vocabulary is a barrier to civilian employment... SO IS civilian vocabulary when a veteran has to ""try on"" new labels (what do you mean ""project manager"" is a desirable title... we use it to mean ""odd job catcher""), some of which would appear to be a downgrade, or less than flattering in military setting.

If you decide to return to an in-person event... maybe you could split the 3day event, to two 1.5 day events, in-person SVA Unit Management Fiesta, and immediately follow up with an online Student Veteran Employment Extravaganza.  You can see how much online response you recieved with an online option! Or livefeed the in-person 3-day event, and provide a parallel networking, breakout, and interview sessions for on-line users.

Tech support was incredibly helpful.
Im glad to have attended. ",Yes,"The learning was personal... 
Not only do veterans have to un-military ourselces for civilian employers' benefit... but we need help re-labeling, or understanding civilian terms,  that when directly applied to military circles would be downgrading or unflattering titles.

You know when you read an annual evaluation/FITREP, and you know the person was a low performer but not a bad performer,  and was probably used as FOD to allow the best to be highly ranked... yep, the words we use to describe that group, are the ""glamorous"" titles the civ community wants to assign me, for my life's aspirations.
How do I reconcile ""aspiring for the bottom rung"" with striking out for a new / second career?!  ... well, by interacting with all these folks.

Alumn chat, those who know military, but have current civ employment experience.","Please expand the employment portion of the conference.

Maybe someone could monitor for appropriateness, legitimate, functioning, or duplicate suggested transition resources... and allow peoole to download it during or after the conference... too many recommendations for OneNet or ONet (whatever)... you know what a Navy helicopter pilot is on that site... an airline pilot (um, no, we're not)... but how is that useful anyway, when looking for an unrelated Process Improvement career, following an again unrelated PhD in Molecular Neuroscience Medical Research. 

My opinion... Veterans using VA benefits for grad school, should have a MANDO concurrent payback, of participating in a VA or SVA ""Veteran Grad School"" program... so that new Grad applicants, current Grad students, and possibly alumni can share experience, get the best out of a degree, help direct, give advice, support new/current stidents... and have a moderator limit the complaining about their personal, one-off, irritation about VA medical benefits... thats a different forum.

I thought we were supposed to get some, but there was only NatCon stuff (which I appreciate!). Would have made it seem even more like a real conference. No big deal if you can’t though. 
Suggestions to make the conference even better:
Registering and logging in was a bit confusing. There was no easy way to see if I was registered because I kept going back to the same screen as if I hadn’t. Thank goodness for the emails because that’s how I could get in. Otherwise I would have missed the conference. The My Agenda feature would be more beneficial if it linked directly to the breakouts. Having to go back to the agenda list to find it was irritating.
Consider having additional social breakout rooms (lounges) with general topics that are chat based and monitored. People seem to like the chat feature in the forums, and having a few rooms to go into would replicate socials or hanging out in main hallways waiting for the next session  experienced IRL. I’ve seen it work great in other virtual conferences. They also had a moderator of sorts who would put out 1MC/broadcast messages in the lobby informing participants that a certain discussion was happening in the lounge:breakout space. The conversations were free flowing topics, but having 3-4 spaces made it so you could find something interesting . "

The chat function was awful. 

I am now going back through the on-demand library for sessions that I could not attend live. I am distraught that several sessions (listed below) are not to be found in the library. Is there any chance they will be made available and posted soon? I was especially interested in the first one listed below- I could use the advice! Thank you.
Breakout sessions:
HOW TO BE A CHAPTER LEADER WITHOUT LOSING YOUR MIND
HOW TO BE ENGAGED IN SVA AFTER GRADUATION
""VETERAN INCLUSIVE"" VERSUS ""VETERAN FRIENDLY""
General sessions:

It didn't seem like the students could spend much time in one place if they really wanted to see multiple booths.",Likely ,"I thought the virtual setup was very well done. There were lots of things to explore and great break out sessions. Loved the appearance by Jill Biden. I think we would all prefer to be face to face, but this forum shouldn't be tossed out if we ever do make a return to ""normal"".  I think this virtual booth in tandem with a live event would allow SVA to engage everyone. If it has to be virtual again, maybe consider adding a half a day."

The ability to engage with sessions geared toward certain topics vs. meet and greet style in a physical setting was great. I would highly suggest breaking NatCon into either a hybrid model or have employers do a virtual conference separate from the in-person conference so students can focus on their chapters and breakout sessions.

EN,"Brand recognition,Recruiting employees,Other",Learn best practices from other employers,Other,,Minor progress in achieving goal,"1. None of the formal breakout session tracks was geared towards employers; content for students regarding employment was minimal and heavily geared towards non-profit/government service.  An attempt needs to be made to integrate employers, who are major donors to the conference, into the breakout sessions.  Good topics include those around preparing students for private sector employment and helping employers learn best practices from each other on veteran talent acquisition, retention, and promotion.  A breakout session track geared around private-sector employment would go a long way towards addressing this issue.

2. The Hiring our Heroes event was rushed and allowed no time for employer representatives to ask questions, network, or collaborate.  The event focused exclusively on hiring while our main goal was to learn best practices on retention and career advancement practices for veterans in other companies.  Time is needed to allow employer representatives to interact under less structure and allow time for unmoderated panel discussion or attendee questions.

3. The diversity & inclusion event MUST BE FIXED!  This is a high priority topic for many private sector participants, including my company; it needs to be successful for our support of SVA to maintain credibility with our senior corporate leadership.  Too much was planned for too little time.  Very little value was derived from the discussion.  The short period of time allocated to senior education and business leaders was borderline insulting.  I am glad my company was edged out on sponsoring this event as it would have been very unsuccessful at meeting our goals had we participated.

4. Breakout sessions need more quality control.  Examples I observed include:
a) sole presenter in a session with typos on multiple slides
b) broad conclusions being drawn from scientifically small sample sizes
c) panel moderators failing to promote all panelists from participating
d) panel moderators speaking more than the expert/guest panelists
e) rushing through topics due to poor time management",3,Unsure / Don't Know,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Very interested,Yes ,"None, 0","None, 0","None, 0",Neutral ,Strongly Disagree,Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Neutral ,Not Applicable,Strongly Disagree,Strongly Disagree,Disagree,Extremely slow for my needs,Just right for my needs,Yes,Yes,Yes,Couldn't capture leads at beginning of conference,"Link directly to a resume that I can review on the spot

Higher traffic (i.e. more student attendees) is needed to make this a stronger investment for our recruiting efforts.

2. None of the formal breakout session tracks was geared towards employers; content for students regarding employment was minimal and heavily geared towards non-profit/government service.  An attempt needs to be made to integrate employers, who are major donors to the conference, into the breakout sessions.  Good topics include those around preparing students for private sector employment and helping employers learn best practices from each other on veteran talent acquisition, retention, and promotion.  A breakout session track geared around private-sector employment would go a long way towards addressing this issue.  I would have also liked to see some sort of social event between SVA leadership and sponsors (e.g. Bronze and higher) that would enable idea exchange and collaboration.

3. Time is needed to allow employer representatives to interact under less structure and allow time for unmoderated panel discussion or attendee questions.

4. The diversity & inclusion event MUST BE FIXED!  This is a high priority topic for many private sector participants, including my company; it needs to be successful for our support of SVA to maintain credibility with our senior corporate leadership and especially our corporate diversity director who is a veteran.  Too much was planned for too little time.  Very little value was derived from the discussion.  The short period of time allocated to senior education and business leaders was borderline insulting.  I am glad my company was edged out on sponsoring this event as it would have been very unsuccessful at meeting our goals had we participated.

5. Events must start and end on time with adequate time to successfully accomplish the goals of each event/meeting/session.  The Honors Banquet was the worst example:
a) Doors to the banquet hall remained closed until 10 past the hour.
b) No ushers were present to assist sponsors/exhibitors/VIPs in finding their assigned tables.  I elected not to sit at my company's table because I could not find it.  I chose to sit with one of the University chapters my company has a strong sponsorship relationship with.
c) Opening remarks were over an hour long when the entire event, including dinner, was only scheduled for two hours.
d) The event ran long by nearly two hours--double its planned duration.  This created a significant hardship with respect to travel planning and severely irritated many attendees as evidenced by the number of people who left during dinner and before the primary program and awards announcements began.

6. The timing of this event in the calendar year does not support our recruiting cycle.  Primary recruiting occurs from 1 September - 15 December.  By January, few if any job opportunities for interns or full-time employees remain.  Hiring managers are loathe to consider candidates in January-May; the perception is that students who have not secured a job by this time period are low quality leftovers.  A conference held in the fall semester--especially October or November--would be much better timed for our needs.  We would be more likely to come to the conference with specific job hiring targets if the conference were held during the fall semester.

7.  A location closer to a corporate office--or at least in oilfield country--would be desirable as it would enable us to more successfully recruit individuals interested in oil and gas careers.

8. Require students to have a GPA in their profile/on their resume for pre-conference candidate screening.

9. Create a mechanism for employers to put their private breakout session events in the conference app schedule for relevant attendees.  For example, if I want to privately invite 100 specific attendees who have a certain major to a breakout session, create a way for me to invite them through the app and have it appear on their agenda in the conference app.

10. The layout of the venue severely impeded success in our private breakout sessions.  The SVA campus (and our booth) were on the opposite end of the venue from the breakout rooms provided for employer use.  A layout that has a central exhibit floor with satellite breakout rooms would be much more desirable and enable better coverage of our different activities.  Barring that, if future venues are similarly laid out as a long line versus a planet-satellite orbit, PLEASE make employer breakout rooms available near to the exhibitor booths.

11. Put school AND academic discipline on students' name badges.

12. I saw very few students carrying the SVA tote with my company's logo.  Most attendees also did not realize that there were print materials from the sponsors in the tote they received at the beginning of the conference.  Professional printed material is not cheap; I am unsure that it delivered value on our investment and may be something SVA should consider reducing or eliminating altogether.  I particularly offer this suggestion in light of repeated feedback from SVA conference staff that the primary means of reaching SVA conference attendees was electronically (text, email, conference app).",Unsure,"SVA needs to make a fundamental decision about the purpose of this conference and what stakeholder group is the primary customer.  My perception is that the SVA desires to finance the conference with private sponsorships but primarily serve the needs of students.

It is not reasonable for SVA to expect private sector exhibitors, sponsors and donors to fund this conference on an ongoing basis if their needs (recruitment, commitment to diversity & inclusion, and brand recognition) are not adequately met.  Social responsibility is not sufficient to justify ongoing commitment to the SVA; I must be able to show value in information exchange and/or recruiting to continue my involvement with the national conference."

EN,"Brand recognition,Networking,Recruiting employees",,Networking,,Moderate progress in achieving goal,"We didn't see a ton of foot traffic come through our booth (we loosely kept track as well, and it was down from 2018 and 2017). I think it would help if the SVA campus were open for 2-4 hours per day instead, and if this time were dedicated to the SVA campus.

This way, corporate partners can review resumes in advance and determine invite-only reception attendees, 1:1 participants, etc. Ideally, these resumes were delivered with full name and email address via a spreadsheet. Dropbox doesn't allow you to filter by graduation month/year, major, etc., which makes it difficult to filter down to what we're looking for, at least initially. I realize it's tough to get students to submit a resume immediately, but it would be most useful if a first wave of resumes were provided by end of November, and then a second/final wave by mid-December. This would provide ample time for our recruiting teams to screen, give me time to reach out to schedule 1:1s, and accommodate the holidays. 

Additionally, I'm concerned about the level of professionalism and the level of commitment towards recruitment I observed. 35% of invite-only reception RSVPs no-showed vs. 17.2% in 2018. Only 16.7% of emailed attendees responded to an email inviting them to participate in a 1:1 resume review vs. ~90% for other conferences. As mentioned previously, we also just saw less foot traffic. In fact, it went by by over 50% this year as compared to last year. This falls in line with my observation that students were more interested in hanging out with each other or leaving early to go to Disney World, than with approaching corporate partners. I'm wondering if it would make sense to have some messaging about professionalism go out prior to the conference to emphasize expectations there. I have other specific examples we can discuss over the phone. ",Extremely Likely,"It would be great if there were a map of where schools and corporate partners are located. Otherwise, as per usual, we had a great time and we enjoyed meeting with the students we did end up speaking to. Thanks for the opportunity! "

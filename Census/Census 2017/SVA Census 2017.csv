I got very involved in college matters; I served as Senator-at-Large in Associated Students, California State Student Association, appointed by CSU Chancellors office to serve on the Student Mental Health committee; Ambassador to : Native American Student Union, Title IX committee, LGBTQ union, NAACP union, MECHA union, and served as special rep for the Veterans Club. At first I felt I would be out of touch with all the young students, but they embraced me because of my dedication and extensive experiences with life; I was voted Officer of the Year for Associated Students; was invited by professors to give lectures in classes about my experience in Laos during the Vietnam War, the anti-war movement, Civil Rights movement  and Chicano Movement. Because I have two sons who came-out as gay, I was admired for my decision to educate myself about the LGBTQ community so I would not lose my children's love to ignorance and rejection.

Programs which truly provide good jobs and opportunities with upward mobility are only available to veteran officers. Programs aimed at enlisted veterans, target only manual labor jobs or positions which require little if any education and greatly deter enlisted veterans from pursuing higher education. I find it offensive that those who need the most help in advancing their careers, enlisted veterans, the ones who chose to forego an earlier education, are even further penalized by these types of programs.

College of Southern Maryland student and Navy veteran, Bill Buffington, of White Plains, was one of 125 students chosen from 1,500 applicants to attend this summerÂ’s Student Veterans Association (SVA) Leadership Institute in Bentonville, Arkansas.

Hosted by Walmart Corporate Headquarters, the Leadership Institute is a cohort-based program for emerging leaders within the SVA to learn best practices and operational concepts to aid in strengthening the local chapters. In addition to training, attendees had the opportunity to network with Walmart corporate leaders.

 Â“I was honored to be chosen to represent the veteran students enrolled at CSM and to learn what other institutions around the country are doing to assist their veteran student populations,Â” said Buffington who is the vice president of CSMÂ’s Veterans Organization. Â“The program gave me the opportunity to meet my peers at Florida State, George Mason University, San Diego State and so many other great schools, and to participate in workshops where we collaborated on solutions to real-life scenarios and challenges that affect student veterans on campuses all over the country.Â” 

The Department of Veterans Affairs reports that for the fiscal year 2013, there were 1.09 million people as VA education beneficiaries. According to data provided by SVA, 85 percent of student veterans are age 24 or older, 47 percent have a family and 27 percent are female. Speaking to the American Association of Community Colleges in 2012, Former Veterans Administration Secretary Eric K. Shinseki said, Â“At the end of 2011, we had over 950,000 veterans and eligible family members enrolled in collegeÂ…The nation's community colleges have been at the forefront of the new GI Bill, providing high-quality and innovative college courses to over 235,000 Veterans and service members.Â”

â€œCSM welcomes the opportunity to assist active duty military personnel, veterans and their families,â€?said CSM President Dr. Brad Gottfried. â€œAs one of the largest veteran-serving colleges or universities in the state of Maryland, CSM is proud to help more than 900 military students and their dependents each year as they strive to reach their academic and career goals.â€?
â€œBill Buffington is a fantastic advocate for our veteran students. He actively seeks them out, guides them, and helps them find the resources they need to succeed,â€?said CSM Vice President for Student and Instructional Support Services Dr. Bill Comey.

Buffington, who is studying business administration at CSM, is no stranger to the challenges veteran students face.

Â“Student veterans who are transitioning from a military culture where discipline and precision are required look to their institution to help them transition to an academic culture where diversity of ideas, individualism, and creativity are encouraged. Also, consider the frustration a veteran feels when he or she is paired with a student that doesnÂ’t have the same level of discipline or motivation,Â” said Buffington.

Â“Veteran students are dealing with other issues as well, including self-identification on campus. They donÂ’t want to be labeled or stand out as representing an event that took place while serving, but they also donÂ’t want to try to blend in with students who just graduated from high school and have no experiences outside of their hometown. My job as the Veterans Club vice president and the SVA representative is to be the middlemanÂ—to find out what student veteran needs are and communicate those needs to faculty and college administrators,Â” said Buffington.

Buffington, whose military career included two nominations as Sailor of the Year, and numerous selections as Sailor of the Quarter has achieved just as stellar an academic career. His performance in the classroom has earned him a spot on the DeanÂ’s List, and he was elected to the collegeÂ’s chapter of the National Society for Leadership and Success as well as Phi Theta Kappa, the National Honor Society for community colleges.

For Buffington, the SVA Leadership Institute provided many ideas that he will share with staff at CSM such as best practices for recruitment and retention of veteran students, developing a stronger student veteran organization on campus, and further building trust and relationships with college faculty and administrators.

 Â“The big takeaway from the conference is that the transitioning process requires patience and understanding on all fronts, between student veterans and traditional college students, between college administrators and vets and most importantly between faculty and vets,Â” said  Buffington.

In the community, Buffington has founded the Veterans Coffee Breaks held at and sponsored by the  Chic-Fil-As in the  Southern Maryland Region and Founder and CEO of VConnections, Inc. a veteran and family support organization in Waldorf.

I spend nearly every second of everyday with my service dog Captain. The Rebel Vets not only accepted us into their tribe, they saw something in me that I did not see in myself. They had faith enough in me to become their chapter president. Ever since then, I have had the greatest joy representing our 1,800 student vets on campus. We have helped pass crucial laws in our state that will benefit student vets for generations to come. We have given back to our community after the horrific tragedy that took place on October 1st, 2017. Captain and I now have lifelong friends that are more like family. Serving student veterans has become my life's mission. There is no national student organization like Student Veterans of America. I am beyond proud to be a part of it.

I thought the extensive training I received in the USAF would translate well, but it didn't. Trying to go back to school has been up and down but every college student never truly knows what they want to do. I have to say that having a strong director in a veteran office of a school is paramount for helping veterans in college and can help those having issues with a college because they are an employee of the institution. 

My experience so far has been a controlled storm of chaos but hopefully will calm down with Vet Center help. 

Another issue has been as a medical marijuana patient in a state that allows rec use, finding a job proves difficult. If I quit the medical regime then I might lose my sanity. I am a huge advocate for mmj use in veterans to help with depression and PTS related obstacles. 

Also the VA counselor I have is inept when creating a relationship and lack of help makes using Ch. 31 benefits a burden. One meeting he had the wrong student pulled up on the computer. The lack of attention to detail worries me, due to the possibility that he could make gross errors that would affect an student veteran.

I get more help and guidance from the school student veteran office than I do the VBA.

I feel like there is a lack of recognition (I don't want a fucking participation trophy) for those of us that did a job outside the scope of ground combat. There are groups whose sole dedication is serving those that are ""broken"" or ""damaged"", and undoubtedly there are benefits for those that need assistance in transitioning from those self-ascribed, clinicical diagnosis, or  stigmatic names. I guess what I'm dancing around is that I don't feel like I qualify for programs that I'm sure might help me be a better person, because all I ever did was ride a tin can around the pacific. That being said, I'm not looking for a participation trophy for being a vet, nor do I lament the fact that I chose a job that fit my qualifications and curiosities. I am my own man, and I chose my path, and am planning my future based off choices that I've made, good bad or otherwise, and I fully support Veteran programs that offer assistance to those that need it the most, but I perceive a gap between programs that seek out Veterans that wear the mantle of ""damaged""-not as a crutch, but as a byproduct of their service. These Veterans deserve to be served in this manner, yet there is a clear lack of support for those of us that don't fit the rubric setforth. I'm not lamenting, just illustrating. This is probably the wrong platform, but if I don't mention it, someone who can do something might not ever see it.

Also, I am wholly disheartened by the young kids that I share my academic experience with. There is a severe lack of enthusiasm for learning, and it frustrates me.

From my prospective, it looks as though an emphasis has been placed on helping veterans gain employment with entry level and/or non-technical positions. This is great, but unfortunately those individuals with technical or graduate degrees are not getting the assistance they could be getting. I was an officer (bachelor degree / engineering), but my service connected injuries prevent me from entering an engine room ever again. I had to change fields and decided to get a graduate degree in physics (more of a desk orientated job). I feel completely on my own now that I'm looking for employment. I am able to gather bits and pieces of information, but I feel that there is more that others might be able to help individuals in my situation with, if they were aware that individual were struggling this way. Although the aforementioned veterans (non-technical bachelor degree, entry-level) are the largest demographic, there are still other groups out there that could benefit more from specialized assistance. I also find that the recruitment from government employers is lacking in the veteran community. This is just my limited view of things, but if I see things this way then others might too.

It has been and continues to be a reciprocal system; I needed help in every way and the VA was there to provide that help.  But, and it's a BIG but, we as veterans have to realize we are dealing with, not some innocuous organization, but individuals within that organization.  Individuals that have various backgrounds and training that have brought them to positions of responsibility within the VA thereby impacting both themselves and the very people they are there to assist.  They impact us, and they must never forget, that we are going to impact them as well.  And herein is the problem and one that all of us together must face, the Vets and the VA.  We must not let anything breakdown, whether it's eligibility, health care, counseling, or whatever it is that has been put in place to assist all those who have answered the call to serve in the military.  That breakdown usually occurs either when a Vet is discouraged about the ""system,"" or when a representative is not sensitive to what can be done or what should be done for the Vet.  
I always tell the young bucks to advocate for themselves, that they must speak up because no one is perfect, especially not us, nor those who have such a grave responsibility in such a large a large organization such as the VA.  It's a partnership and we all need to remember that, it is called ""The Veterans Administration"" for a reason, let's together, keep it that way!",,,Army,Veteran,E-3,Yes,"Severe	","Severe	","Severe	","Severe	","Severe	",Some,None,"Severe	","Severe	","Severe	","Severe	","Severe	",Some,None,,1967,1969,Vietnam War,,Yes,Robert,Di Grappa,robertdigrappa@outlook.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Never imagined myself joining the military. Also never imagined myself getting a master's degree. Looks like I have done both. By joining the military, it gave me access to pursuing a higher degree. By being an officer, combined with my prior 17 years of business experience, I had access to the Executive MBA. This further prepared me for the career change - by weaving together the elements of my prior work, my MOS abilities/capabilities, and my leadership role as an officer.

What I thought would be my biggest challenge (going back to school after 20 years), turned out to be very easy due to the veteran's center on campus, plus being part of a more mature program (average age was 39-year-olds).

The American Council of Education did not grant us educational credits for our military education. Our SMART transcripts are worthless in the public educational system. The Post 9/11 MGIB does not carry the service-member through a 4 year degree because it takes more then 4 years to accomplish that degree. In reality, college class scheduling requires a student to take classes during spring, summer, and fall semesters just to take the required classes for their chosen degree path. Additionally, due to these scheduling conflicts that are out of the service-members control, it can easily take 5 years of full-time student attendance to achieve a Bachelors Degree. However, the funds from the Post 9/11 MGIB typically run out long before that, causing the service-member to drop-out of college or find employment to pay for the remainder of credits out-of-pocket. In my personal experience, if I had not been found 100% disabled by the VA and made eligible for the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program, I would NOT have been able to afford attending college full-time and would have been in the situation to seek employment with no relatable skills from the US military in the civilian sector.

Because of having to take remedial coursework at a community college, I used all but 1 month and 23 days under CH. 33. I applied and was accepted to use four months of CH.31 to complete my BA in Psychology. 

I would like to earn an MA in Public Administration, but do not have enough entitlement to pay for it. If I did the Master's Degree would them become a debt issue. Because I am gainfully employed, CH. 31 will NOT accept my case to complete a Master's degree. If it was paid for by the VA, I would already be enrolled in a program. I am new in my current role and hope to be eligible for discounts after my six-month probationary period ends.

I hope this helps to identify issues that can help other veterans. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at 313-583-6594. 

Thanks for the work you do!

We are not legally married and are not technically in a romantic relationship, but she and I do live together. We are domestic partners through her employer so I can be on her health insurance. I was stay-home dad for my twin girls for 7 years - my girls are now 7 and in 2nd grade as of this writing (18 October 2017).

Being Guard, I had no idea that I was eligible for the GI Bill, and the first time I ever heard about it was when I saw a Vet's rep at an employment center in May 2016. My Title 10 Active duty tour ended 31 August 2002.  I believe the Post 9/11 GI Bill started 2009, but at that point, I was busy being stay-home dad and had NO IDEA that I was eligible for any GI Bill.

Even though I had several months to go on my GI Bill, the 15 years after Active Duty is a hard and fast rule, and my GI Bill expired 1 September 2017 (de-limiting date).  I requested that the VA please extend my de-limiting date, to no avail, and with no right to appeal their ""no"" answer, since I am not disabled. 

The new Forever GI Bill does not help me at all, in that it is only for persons who got off of Active Duty after 2013. 

I am now trying to work and finish my A.S. degree. Because I already have a bachelor's, I am ineligible for federal financial aid, but am receiving a Board of Governors (BOG) tuition/fee waiver at LA Harbor College.  I am grateful for the BOG, but it is not providing me with any income as the GI Bill would.

I wish the VA and the SVA could provide some type of advocacy/assistance for people stuck in the big 15-year ""Catch 22"" basically discriminatory unfairness of the Post-9/11 GI Bill.",3,,Air Force,Individual ready reserve or inactive reserve (IRR),E-7,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1986,2007,"Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) â€?All Locations,Operation Northern / Southern Watch",,Yes,Timothy,Johnson,tjjohnson61@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-Quiz out- Never needed to be listed as a class because it was free and only a one-time event. Because it was listed on the VA form by the school, and then they ""dropped"" the class after the test, the VA paid the school, and then I owed the VA over $700.
-I have also been sent by the VA to a collections agency for a $900 bill because the VA Rep at my school spoke to the VA personnel on the phone and instructed me it would be taken out of my next-semester's benefits and told me not to pay it...then it was sent to collections and is effecting my credit.

However, as I get stressed out and overwhelmed, especially toward the end of the term when final papers, projects, and exams are looming, the stress definitely gets to me. One quarter, I was taking an especially challenging class (neuroscience for speech/language). Even though I was grasping the material, my brain was doing so much work that I started waking up at night thinking I'd heard indirect fire (IDF) - even though it had been over 5 years past my time in Iraq. Unfortunately, my way of coping has become avoidance. When things start to get overwhelming and stressful, I find myself shutting down because I don't want my symptoms to flare up. Of course, this is not a productive strategy. 

I try to share my story and experience with as many veterans as possible. I also try to emphasize the importance of a sense of belonging can make at school. This is my third attempt at graduate school, but the first in which I've made it through the first year and have neared completion. One of the biggest differences that has kept me motivated has been my involvement with my program cohort and with the student veterans organization on campus.

You can find evidence from the 14th century or before, and it comes from the root Geno/Gen, which we also get ""begin"" from, or what sex did you ""begin"" with, thus your ""gender"" is your birth sex since it is what you were ""born"" with, in my case, male, but stop catering to redefining the english language. You aiding the erosion of order, and who the hell gave you the power to redefine the english language. It is slang, nothing more, and I am appalled that you have included gender slang into this survey. It erodes your credibility because it displays ignorance towards the English language that students are supposed to appreciate. It is not a matter of ""bigotry"" either, so don't assume that label, either. It is simply someone standing up for proper use of the English language...

However, I have witnessed too much partisanship is some of the higher echelons of its past leadership. I also have an issue with someone railing against for-profits and then going to work with them as a lobbyist. My beef isn't with a political party or against for-profits. Its about the integrity of an organization that is representative of the veteran voice on a national scale. We come from all backgrounds. As a result SVA needs to advocate for veterans from a non-partisan foundation. We are bigger than political parties and too important to feel the divisiveness that exists in our country right now, and we need the voice of SVA to be empowered to speak to both sides, no matter who is the president of SVA or who is the president and political party affiliation running the country. Toss aside political affiliation when wearing the SVA hat. Represent us all without knowing what political background we come from, and advocate for proper use of the English language instead or marginalizing and eroding yourself by catering to political correctness. It is sickening that an organization representing students is engaging in the use of social language slang. LGBT is just like having ""homey, bro, dude"" be used to identify as ""HBD"". Stop the delineation of our culture. It is divisive, even within the LGBT community, where QTPOC are taking issue with those of different color even within the same community. All it does it generates divisiveness when we keep drawing social lines and self-segregating ourselves culturally and SVA doesn't need to wallow in the chaos of sexualized identities that need to be kept personal. Rise above the madness and start carrying a sense of honor about the people you represent. Otherwise, you will loose your audience, the people you seek to represent, and you will tarnish your name, just like you did to some extent with some of the questions you asked in this survey. We are veterans who defend America! Not some social experiment guinea pigs!! With that being said, thank you for what you do to represent out nation's veteran students. It is appreciated. I just don't want to see this organization became an arm of a political party and be used in a way that is disgraceful to our nation's veterans.

I just wish the lines of communication with humans would be more free flowing. A Veteran with twenty or more years of Honorable service should be able to have their experience in the military used for certain courses without so much ""BS"". Too many individuals in the upper chain of the college feel as though they do not owe anything to the students. If it is your job to speak with a student about a matter of importance, then why not take the time to indulge. I have absolutely no ""RESPECT"" for the dean of students. I hate it with a passion when a person is in a position to do good and does the total opposite. I served in three wars, I should not feel like I have to fight day to day for my degree now that I am home. I sacrificed twenty plus years in the military, the least this person could have done is sacrificed of few moments of their time, especially since there was no other students waiting. My  advocate and I waited patiently (over an hour) to be treated in such an unforgiving manner. Thank GOD for the assistant working in that office. Now this person is absolutely WONDERFUL! She genuinely cared about what was happening to me even after the ""Wicked Witch"" walk right by me in the waiting area and did not even acknowledge me sitting there with my advocate.

I have had to miss weeks of classes on top of extra research opportunities, different clinician presentations, educational workshops and much more in my field of study due to drill weekends that are unwilling to accomodate civilian career training opportunities, with drill weekends averaging 4 days out of the month. For this coming semester, I am left in an unfortunate situation where I am required to miss 3 weeks of classes and finals week which is incredibly difficult to make-up. I realize that professors are legally obligated to give student-soldiers time to make up work, but the student-soldiers miss out on in-class lectures that are extremely valuable to oneâ€™s education, with the class time being replaced by online homework that is undoubtedly less enriching than having a professor teach you. My outlook of the Army/National Guard/Reserve has changed drastically due to the ultimate disadvantages that it provides when one is trying to pursue career opportunities through college and technical training schools and I would ask anyone wishing to join the Guard/Reserves to seriously consider if the military is right for them if they want to enroll in a college program while in service.

My last semester closed with 18 hours which was rough
but I did alright still maintained my 3.0 GPA.




Towards the end of last year I was having a physical done for a routine
check up and they did some blood work which revealed I had developed a blood
disorder most likely from being on Accutane (a form of acne medicine)  when
I was younger.  With this diagnosis it will make my future officer career in
the Army impossible.




I am overall healthy, no worries there and with medication i'll lead a
normal healthy life however I will just need to readjust my future career
plans.

I will remain in school at Texas Tech with my major in Public Relations
through graduation.  I have been researching the idea of possibly getting a
job following graduation with the DoD, State Department or similar.  I just
wanted to do the courtesy of informing you and apologizing for all the time
and effort you dedicated to my career, I will never forget it and am forever

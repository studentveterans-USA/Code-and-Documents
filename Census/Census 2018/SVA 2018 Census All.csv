Many veterans, like myself, are dependent on the BAH stipend. When our bills are not paid, we have a difficult time focusing on our academic goals. We served honorably and earned our benefits yet to receive them is an uphill battle. We thought the fight was over when we left active duty but it was only the beginning. We only want to succeed by utilizing our benefits to make a difference. I look forward to the day I have my degree in hand and do not have to depend on the government. My goal is utilize my benefits to help others and this is my motivation through all the bureaucracy. We talk about the potential and investment of student veterans. I wonder how much more successful we would be if we received what was owed to us in a timely manner. However, it illustrates the determination of us all that we persevere.

When I first went to school for my undergraduate degree in 2003, no one knew how to help me or what my benefits entailed. I had to learn everything on my own. Working with students today, I see a wide variety of challenges and barriers to success, including lack of institutional support services (including from colleges/universities that are designated ""military-friendly""). Frequently student military experience is not appreciated in the classroom. One student was even told, ""That's not the experience I want you to talk about. I want you to talk about real life."" The stress of maintaining family and work obligations while going to school also adversely affects our students, especially if there are other medical conditions involved. There are so many things that I could talk about, but what I think people really need to understand is that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach that is effective for our students because they come from all walks of life and situations.

I didn't know or meet anyone affiliated with a veteran program until my junior year of undergrad. Even then, resources were limited, and faculty sponsorship participation is rare. Veterans are again isolated, as non traditional students and believers in the constitution.

We are then forced into further debt by obtaining a graduate degree, which again isn't lucrative unless you have 2 or three years experience in the particular field. The GI bill barely covers books per semester for most, but for me, the Montgomery bill had been suspended, so I  have no financial benefits as far as my time in the military.

As a leader in the veteran community, it has been a challenge to eat our university in board with SVA specifically. They seem to think it’s only for students so we get set aside especially for funding to go to NATCON. Specifically, our veterans department funds vets to attend other conferences but won’t find SVA because they won’t listen to us explain how important it is. Would love some help with this issue.

However, I am concerned that the current political climate will create a ""backswing"" of the pendulum as it were. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and its attendant benefits were certainly the most constructive and definitive changes to help veterans access post-service education and training in our nation's history. I worry, though, that as our numbers diminish these programs may become a target for ""easy"" budget cuts.

I would also like to see how other universities and colleges structure their SVA chapters and what benefits/services they provide and deem necessary. One of our hardest challenges each year was providing persuasive arguments for funding from the Student Activities Commission. It's also extremely difficult to find new people each year to run these SVA organizations. During my tenure I calculated that I was easily spending 25-40 hours per week on SVA issues, while trying to juggle a family and a full-time class load.

It would help to have employers that are friendly to vets that would allow one to make up the hours so you can take your class and still make your projected graduation date while still making up your work hours.  In the eighteen years I have only had one employer let me have that and only because I was able to negotiate for it successfully.

At my age I could care less.  I spent my years in the Marines paying off student loans from an Ivy League university.  I don't want more debt.  fix the way schools take in applications for minorities.  When a school would not update transcripts for students transferring in it becomes a problem if you are trying to stay local in your city.  For four years I could not enroll at the University of Houston at Clear Lake.  I made a scene and appealed to my professor that the school would not allow me to enroll.  I have 172 credit hours in a dual degree program.  Still no degree.  When I transferred in they did not award me the scholarship, I had with a 3.6 GPA from Junior college. Admissions never cleared up hold on account due to having enrolled there previously right after leaving the Marines in 2002.  They kicked me out because the records office was not adding the new transcripts into my file.  I sent a new transcript every semester when I re-applied. By 2010, I lost GIBILL benefits because I did not complete degree on time.  Got fed up and started a second associates at junior college.  The 'system' was racist as fuck.  The UHCL records office run by some bitter old black woman was trying to keep the Latino population below 20% so more African Americans could enroll and their programs get more funding.  I know because I threatened to sue and the investigation's findings were shared by the Dean back in 2010.  Then I realized I either stop working to finish my degree and burden myself with more debt or keep my job and take only classes at night when available (my program has some courses for daytime only).  My only option is to go back to being a junior if I transfer.  Logistically driving 50 miles one way is a bitch in Houston traffic just to make it to class on time for 7PM class.  Forget it.  

2. Make housing affordable or via military grants.  Keeping a roof over my head meant having to cut back on how many courses to take and part time classes doubles the time to complete my degree.  I use the bus to cut my fuel costs."

I am not active with the veteran or SVA communities because I feel unwelcome and that people say things that indicate they don’t believe that I am a veteran. When I see advertising for SVA or VA, none of the pictures of supposed veterans look like me or my battles. So at school and even in life I feel very alone. I am also doing my program complete online now, although I do see veterans events for on campus students but there aren’t a lot of events or effort by my school’s SVA to engage out of state online only students who physically can’t make it to campus. Also, I did physically attend orientation at my program but SVA did not have anyone at the program, so maybe staying abreast of what programs different departments around campus are doing and try to find out if SVA can attend. Also, perhaps sensitivity training for non-veteran staff members around campus can be something SVA does to help civilians interact with veterans. When I went to my department’s orientation, a presenter asked who all were veterans so she could give us information about certification, but when I raised my hand right in front of her face she looked me in the eye and then ignored me. Which goes back to the first point about minority women and representation. Maybe SVA can remind people that our generation of veterans aren’t just old, white men anymore. That experience caused my anxiety and depression to go into overdrive and I wanted to quit my program before I even started.

I believe if we had a person visit the campus to educate the importance of an SVA chapter, it would be more helpful for school to know why they should invest their time in SVA activities. The SVA can be the transitional arm, which can help Veterans prepare for employment. In school, I noticed that many Veterans were not addressing their mental health issues. Once these people graduated they were expected to find employment, but I don't think they were ready for that yet. There has to be some type of ""Resilience Training"" like the Brothers At War workshops offered by executive producer, Gary Sinise. This can help Veterans process what they've been through, while providing mentorship to start the next chapter of their lives. 

Also, I was involved in setting up the 1st ever SVA chapter in Puerto Rico, 2015. We NEED more SVA representation out there.  I can help with that. I will be living in Puerto Rico, December of 2018, please let me know what I can do to help the SVA. I love this organization.

I think it's unfair that we could not use it beyond the 15-year mark, especially when we did not know about it and despite going to at least 2 veterans fairs where no one told me about it. Of course, for the VA, ignorance of the law is no excuse, but sometimes it should be.

My Army Guard active duty time was my basic/OIT, and I did a two-week Title 10 tour to Honduras with my unit. I then did 14 years in Wisconsin Air National Guard, working in Information Management then as a Paralegal/Law Office Manager, AFSC 5J071. From 1 October 2001 - 31 August 2002, I was on a Title 10 Active Duty tour in the Air National Guard of the United States, working mostly home station, in support of Operation Noble Eagle. During that time, for a 45 days, I did a Title 10 tour in support of Operation Southern Watch at Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, from about 31 May 2002 - 15 July 2002. 

I think that both Congress and the VA fell down on the job about letting eligible veterans know about the Post 9/11 GI Bill. I got out of the Guard in July 2007. Congress/VA passes the Post 9/11 GI Bill sometime in '09. I was a stay-home dad in '09 and went to 2 different Veterans Fairs, just as a fishing expedition to see what benefits, if any, I may be eligible for. No one told me anything about the Post-9/11 GI Bill. It was as if you passed this great benefit, but didn't want to tell anyone about it. And then when I tried to request an extension, you/the VA set up some steep criteria for when you could extend someone's GI Bill expiration.  I know there's nothing that can be done about my situation retroactively, and I have had to juggle school and work to finish my degree. It would just be nice if my Post-9/11 GI Bill could somehow be retroactively converted to the Forever GI Bill, which is a really good deal.

If I was attending classes in person I would receive a great deal more (double!) and this would help our financial situation a great deal, but simply because I do not live near enough to my campus to physically attend classes, they do not pay the full amount, so we struggle to make ends meet.  I do not have any spare time to have a job, how could I?  This is essentially punishing me for taking classes at the school of my choice (the alma mater of my parents and siblings) and while our children are young.

That’s not to say it’s bad, just that with the disabilities developed in the military extra complications have risen. And the university does NOT make life easier. Catering only to traditional students, there are no one line classes, or alternative schedules for those with disabilities who have a difficult time sitting through a two hour class due to pain and anxiety. And the claim that many colleges are “veteran-friendly” is nothing more than a joke. Just because a school accepts the GI Bill does not make it veteran-friendly. The Unviersity of Tampa, for instance, refuses to give veterans their own space; even when they have financing available to furnish it. Additionally, much of the veterans time is waisted because of difficulties with the school accepting and recognizing military work and training experience as college credit, forcing many to work their way through a degree plan of which, they have years of experience already in. So much of our education benefits go to waist. And when a student-veteran spends more time attempting to get school administrators to not only efficiently speak directly to one another but also the VOCREHAB counsliers, it’s not only frustrating, it’s absurd and takes away from our already limited time. Sometimes, I honestly wonder if using benefits is even worth the hassles.

College courses within a science-based degree are difficult, and I would recommend other veterans wanting to pursue a science degree to first work on university requirements in the first 1-2 years of college, and then try the upper level courses in the last 2 years.

On my campus student veterans are less willing to accept the ""because that is the way we have always done it"" excuse for poor support / service.  Again, academics are not used to being questioned and tend to dig in rather than provide a reasoned response / re-evaluate their processes.

I double majored in math and science, it was hard but I found a job almost immediately. The job search of my friend who graduated at the same time with a humanities major was very different. I once heard something about an initiative to provide additional GI bill time to people majoring in STEM subjects, I think this could be really useful since it would encourage more veterans to go this route which has worked out so well for me. I had to spend an additional year in college and I can see why people might avoid STEM for financial reasons in the short term.

I actually slightly avoided veteran specific resources in my job search since I was looking for a technical job that actually uses my degree. A lot of the veteran job search resources are so general that they are not very helpful to getting people into the specific fields their study might have prepared them for.

We had some additional monies paid for by the state (less than $1,000). Most of my teachers had gotten their degrees by utilizing the GI Bill from the 2nd WW and empathized with all of us that were going to school the same way. I went into the USAF because I couldn't afford to go to college in 1962 on my own and would have been drafted into the US Forces to serve in Nam when I hit my 18th birthday in Aug. of 62. I originally had plans to stay 20 years, but got out after 6 yrs. to attend Ohio University of which I was able to get my BS in Ind. Eng. Tech, and my MBA in 5 years total. I am guessing that my part-time jobs paid for about 1/2 my college while the GI Bill paid the rest. Credit hours were only about $33/hr then, so it was a lot more affordable than it would be now. I was able to live at my parents for most of the time, so I didn't have any rent, and I married one of the professors my graduate year and was able to get my MBA for 1/2 the cost.

I attended six different colleges/universities to earn it and changed my major at least three times.  I feel that I settled on a major because the choices available at online schools, at the time, were very limited.  I was not able to attend regular courses due to a 24/7 rotating schedule and relocation every three to four years.  I was able to complete more when online learning got more popular.  Though it was easier to take one to two courses per semester/quarter; some courses required a lot of self-teaching.  For example; I took Statistics online, while deployed.  In order to gain better understanding of the material, I spent hours watching YouTube videos and struggled to actually learn and retain the information.  
After retirement, I was employed as a contractor through the VA for the VEI/VOW initiative and provided six-hour informational seminars to transitioning veterans.  I also provided a two-day course on technical training options using VA benefits.

I graduated with my BA in May 2018, but the survey wouldn't let me proceed with the 2018 value in the field. So Ieft that question blank, as well as the next one on that module.

Point 2 - As a student-veteran at the University of Virginia, I uncovered a potential loop hole that universities can exploit, which creates blind spots that can potentially burden student-veterans unknowingly.  The 8 Keys of Veterans success, managed by the Department of Education, is a voluntary initiative that universities can opt into and then promulgate on their websites etc; however, the Department of Education does not guarantee how well, or even if universities implement policies that realize those 8 keys.  In short, this is a total farce.  Without some sort of accountability mechanism to drive action, universities can ""look right"" on paper and on their websites, but actually do nothing.  Last I looked, over 2 thousand schools have signed onto the 8 keys, everyday there seems to be a new one.  The 8 keys was the Department of Education's response to President Obama's Executive Order Establishing the Principles of Excellence, mandating that the DoD, VA, and Department of education work together to assist transitioning service members and student veterans in pursuit of their higher education goals.  In my experience, the DoD and VA made great strides in making sure this is happening and there are feedback mechanisms and accountability processes in place, but the Department of Education has completely dropped the ball - which where the bulk of the action is happening in their wheelhouse.  There needs to be some sort of feedback mechanism, where veterans can exercise their voice to commend, critique, and relay information that is university specific.

Point 3 - The GI Bill comparison tool managed by the VA is not updated.  I suspect that there is a breakdown between School Certifying Officials (university level), Education Liaison Representatives (VA level), and the external reporting process (universities/VA/Dept of Education).  For example, The University of Virginia, Main Campus GI Bill comparison tool has not been updated since 2016.  I know for a fact that 2 students haven filed complaints in 2016, which currently does not populate the page.  Granted, I do not know the internal policy that deems a complaint worthy of populating the field, I imagine there is some distinction between arbitrary and adjudicated - although that is unclear from the user view.  The GI Bill comparison tool is the only mechanism I can see thus far that both informs the prospective student veteran, and can potentially drive action at the university level.  It's important that this process works and that the information is relevant so that student-veterans can make an informed choice about where to use their hard earned benefit.

Point 4:  I also suspect that universities automatically equate student-veterans with benefits, and have subsequently implemented processes that equate the two.  This creates a blind spot in that some veterans are strategic in the use of their benefit, and may not use it and instead use financial aid, loans. or their own money in order to use their benefit at a later time for a master's degree that is usually more expensive.  That is the veteran's right, schools should not assume that veterans have or are using their benefit.  Veterans not in the benefit category, then miss opportunities to connect with employers etc (if the university has a career services resource). Another example is a veteran was put ""at the bottom of the financial aid list"" because the financial aid office assumed that her veteran status meant benefit - although, she never initiated ""request to use benefits"" form etc and gave no indication that she was going to use benefits.

Point 5:  Now the VA does have a complaint system that student veterans can use to submit feedback with regard to the principles of excellence (good); however,  those principles do not cover all areas, particularly the 8 keys of Vets Success (incomplete).   In short there is no mandated feedback mechanism that enables and empowers and connects the student veteran informal experience to the formal university structure.  Because the 8 Keys of Vets success is voluntary and not guaranteed, universities don't have to provide such a feedback system.

Closing:  I was a policy student at the University of Virginia and I spent 2 years walking the line and troubleshooting the gaps from the highest level of the executive order to the lowest level - the student-veteran.  I realize it's hard to get 3 federal agencies in sync, but as long as there is no feedback mechanism, administrators will never see the blind spots, and universities will have inconsistent and uneven policies.

They stopped acting like respectable people who had accomplished something in their lives, and started acting like a bunch of whiney kids. It’s like after spending some time with the 18-19 college kids who haven’t ever done anything, they started acting like them...playing the victim, always blaming someone else...instead of helping lead the young kids and show them what life is like. They became the type of veterans some of us didn’t want to associate with because, quite frankly, it was embarrassing that someone who served would role model such child like behavior.

To be frank, for many years, I was still reeling from the diagnosis. Thankfully, I was able to achieve success by having the best faculty team with the late Dr. Warren Scheideman and accomplished Judge Russell Hardigan. I persevered and only learned late in my undergraduate years about some of the expanded resources available. On campus, I served as our college’s senator and President of the Veterans Advocacy Group (former student org and now an alumni chapter). As our leader, I worked to expand the services beyond the student organization including launching an office for veterans, started our SVA partnership, peer-to-peer support, government panel with our state leadership including Maj. Tammy Duckworth, fundraising ceremony honoring the Tuskegee Airmen, Triple Nickles and Buffalo Soldiers in 2010 which led to one donor giving over $500,000 to veterans.

I learned and help others manage barriers to learning especially for adult students and those with chronic illness, especially the many military and veterans reengaging through education. My graduate work was centered on an innovative approach for navigating retention and ongoing success collaboratively with students, alumni, affinity groups, professional and community organizations. We had our first Veterans Career and Entrepreneurship Summit in November and In June, I graduated with my first Masters degree in Veterans and Disability Advocacy and was recently accepted to the DePaul Law School to start in the spring.

I have been living solely on my VA disability and GI Bill while attending graduate school.  The school screwed up my certification to the VA by putting the wrong zip code.  My housing allowance was provided to me an entire semester at about a 85% reduced rate.  I could not even afford to pay my mortgage on my house. I had to use my personal savings to make up the difference and avoid my credit being destroyed by the mortgage lender if I had gone over 90-days without paying a full mortgage payment.  The issue finally got fixed and the VA paid me the housing allowance I was due in a one lump sum.  Then the VA sent me a letter stating that they over paid me and now I have a debt.  I have been arguing with them ever since and for the past two semesters they have been holding my GI Bill hostage (meaning no housing allowance again).  So, I am still paying my mortgage with my savings.  All this because one incompetent university employee entered the wrong zip code.  They created a financial hardship for me and my family.  We even had to burn through more savings to cover our health, dental, and vision insurance.  I would never have used my GI Bill if I knew it was going to be this difficult and cause this many problems.  The certification process should include the Veteran in-the-loop!  When the school completes its portion, then a link should be sent to the Veteran to verify the information is complete.  Then when we hit the submit button, then and only then does our student enrollment information get certified to the VA.  The VA should have to verify that both the university and the Veteran student have reviewed the information.  The current process creates problems like the one I have suffered.  My situation is still not resolved.

The difference in these two (and possibly more) segments creates a gap in appropriate services that policy makers (seeking to help veterans reintegrate into the workforce as productive members of society) would benefit from the research that informs what industries are most conducive to accepting veterans so they can apply incentives to encourage greater proliferation of talent across the US labor force.

However, I wish there had been a paid staff member manning the Vet Center to help us coordinate projects and answer questions to those who stopped in.  Most students are busy enough with school, but vets have the added family/commute/job/disability/reserve-drill issue that makes it difficult to coordinate volunteer opportunities or be available to attend volunteer projects.  I would have liked to see more involvement by the vets on campus and I don't feel we had the resources to reach out to vets and therefore few opportunities to invite vets to come out and participate.  The few of us who did participate had lots of pressure to perform with little training from previous leaders.  Some vets I knew became completely jaded by their experience with the school and the vet center thinking they ""didn't care.""  Not sure what they expected but they were angry.  I really appreciate this chance to give my opinion.

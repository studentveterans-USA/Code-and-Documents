Because I was still stationed there during Desert Storm, I was not deployed to the Middle East.  Between the VA and the different veteran's organizations, I feel like I'm a second-class veteran just because I hadn't been deployed to the Middle East.  I realize that they have different needs, but veterans that honorably performed their duties in other areas during these times deserve the same consideration as to what their needs are as those who deployed.

Most colleges do not appreciate or give credit for non-traditional forms of education including military services, service academies and most importantly operational assignments and responsibilities.2.

Academia generally believes itself to be superior intellectually, morally and with a broadened diversified range of experience; yet truth be known, they are mostly insulated and pampered in a bubble of myopic self-righteousness placed upon a pedestal of their own making and absent of a broad base of experience. In stark contrast to a foundation of experience, like the base of a pyramid built thru a plethora of operational assignments in the Armed Forces. Academia's experience foundations are rather built like an upside down base of experience built upon the apex of the pyramid and only broadened by an indoctrination and complete cultural immersion and adoption of the insulated utopian view of academia which is completely funded by, insulated and immune by the state and federal government.

Working with my Director of Certifying, Melissa Barber, and my Director of Outreach, Dwayne Gordon, we encourage our staff to look for areas that need to be streamlined, through the use of technology and otherwise, and we problem-solve to create and implement solutions for greater efficiency. To provide high-quality, compassionate service to transitioning veterans, and to increase retention, we regularly seek ways to discover best practices in serving veterans used by other universities, and also offer our learnings to other institutions. Part of this effort includes implementing new programs and events, as well as becoming a member of and regularly participating in committees and organizations that strive to help veterans. We proactively seek to provide expanding resources for student veterans by communicating and cooperating with the departments at UNLV and also organizations in the greater Las Vegas community. We continually update our marketing strategy to recruit veterans to enroll at UNLV, including advertisements in military magazines and regular trips to education fairs at military bases.

With that in mind, it is a difficulty to pay back classes we have to drop instantly. Also, the strict amount of months allotted in the GI Bill causes student-vets to put more on their plate than they can handle...which ultimately causes them to have to drop classes or their GPA will suffer. The äóìdropped class pay backäó and the äóì36 months of benefitsäó could perhaps be better tailored to produce more graduates. Additionally, the book stipend usually does not cover the full cost of books. That being said, Iäó»m thankful for every bit of it. Also, the summer adds an interesting difficulty. You can either take one class a month, and you get less out of the GI Bill, or take the summer off, and lose a big source of income for 3 months, which is just long enough to be very uncomfortable, but not long enough to commit to a good paying job. As a result, you have to boost summer employment with short term jobs which hurts your resumíÂ because you look like you hop from job to job frequently.

The whole school and town of Bellingham, WA always had a protest against any military actions, and Student Veterans like myself felt excluded due to the rhetoric of the protests. In addition, the school did not provide and show genuine support to Student Veterans' rights; and the school's Veterans Office was not staffed very well. Fast forward to being a Student Veteran at Syracuse University (SU), I have observe a huge difference of experience. This school is very friendly to Student Veterans and provide a lot of support.

One of the biggest problems was that it was hard to come back from war and deal with the stupidity of college.  The schools idea of something very important was not aligning with what I as a vet considered very important.

Most medical programs that are equivalent to job experience is long and difficult to get into. Example would be Nursing for prior Hospital Corpsman/ Medics have to take a TEAS exam prior to applying to a nursing program. Man Vets like myself have found that we score below average in two categories (reading & language) which prevents us from applying. However we score above the average total score. I know Texas Tech school of nursing has allowed a couple of vets due to this same situation to see how the students will do. The students are in the top of the class and are excelling past other students that scored higher on the TEAS exam. If vets with experience can be exempt from taking this exam a lot more Nursing programs will be flooded with quality students that will excel in the program. Thus elevating the strain that healthcare is facing with the shortage of nurses. ,-2,,Navy,Veteran,E-6,,Some,Very,Very,Severe	,Severe	,Severe	,Some,A little,Very,Very,Very,Severe	,Severe	,Some,100%,2000.0,2016.0,"Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) äóñ All Locations,Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF),Other War on Terror Operation, not listed,Peacetime Service",,Yes,Bernabe,Montejano,bernabe.montejano@me.com,9285815173,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

When everybody was given tax breaks to hire, Vets were everywhere. Now, there is barely a mention unless it is about PTSD or a death overseas.  Vets have  families, and/or other responsibilities. Schools don't understand that. You can tell them till you are blue in the face, they still want them to participate in everything.  Support starts at a System or school Presidential level. If either or both are non-existent, there seems to be little internal notice of Veterans. Student Vets have issues like everybody else, but then have the added stress of broken VA issues. The education side of the VA was okay. Last year, the VA started going down hill there too. The VA is also making changes that the ELRs don't even know about.  You can still call five different times and get five different answers.  I have personally called the VA, asked to talk to a manager and had the discussion about that.  His answer was basically ""that's the way it is. the new guys have to learn.""   Veteran suicide has to stop.  Is it the cocktail of drugs on deployments? Is it feeling alone after you get out? Is it realizing that nobody cares until someone needs people for a grant to be funded? What seems to work is staying connected. That means face to face time, not locked in a trance on a video game or alone in the country.  It seems like the SVA is now leading the charge on most Vet related issues and getting things done.

Iäó»ve heard this is an issue from multiple schools across the nation. The VA website is bad about it, Transition classes are bad about it, and it needs fixed.2) the choice act has gaps for service members on terminal leave that arenäó»t going to school in a home state or where they are on orders. (Simple fix to just include on terminal leave to the language).3) SVA needs to weigh in on Tuition Assistance the program is running out of. Only each year and the response from commands is äóìuse your post 9/11 benefitsäó which seems like a cop out4) I know yäó»all are on it, but the transfer of eligibility rules have to be fixed and the 16 year cap definitely needs to be removed.

I had to take an incomplete over the Summer because I've been struggling with anxiety, but until I finish that class - there is no way to have the VA arrange payment for that class, and I can't pay out of my pocket. I applied for Voc Rehab as soon as my rating was finalized, nearly 6 months ago in Hope's of finding a program that can help me earn my PhD despite my traumatic brain injury and other mental health issues. Even then, there is no certainty the VA will have any reasonable process to help me. If I could have dropped the class or taken a lighter load from the beginning while remaining financially stable, I would have done so.I would also like to see work-study positions available within Congressional District Offices to help Veterans with their benefits and give Veterans, like me, who seek careers in public policy, a better chance to receive paid job experience to worry about the bills less when seeking experience. Further, the ration of Veterans serving as Congressional staff-members is dismal, and most elected members are Pre-9/11 servicemembers.

I have advocated at the CC and University levels for Student Veterans and their Student Families as well.Knowing of and Experiencing the issues between the VA and the Educations system first hand, I forced myself to find alternative solutions to obtaining higher education. Struggling to manage my finances, the requirements of the VA and the Lack of collaboration, communication and cooperation between the VA and Education systems, leaving me and other Veterans in an endless loop of stress and financial hardships was enough for me to resolve on my own what the systems could not and would not. The VA VocRehab put my GIBILL in Jeopardy and it expired unbeknownst to me until checked on it. The VocRehab system failed me and stressed me even more. They made promises of employment, education and security that in one swift moment they denied me. However, by that time, I had made alternative choices and regained my sanity and drive for education (as best as I could : ) ). At this point I am still struggling but this time its self inflicted and involves only my ability to stay focused. I work two jobs and have survived bankruptcy, my home is under foreclosure but I am remaining positive that I am overcoming all that I went through.

However, there are some short falls as many veterans are behind in academics when transitioning from service, due to a break in school. So, when they return to a Junior College or 4 year institution they are waiting GI Bill on classes that do not count for credit (i.e. predatory English & math classes). The other issue is when a veteran does attend a JC and goes to transfer some classes do not count at the 4 year institutions, once again putting the veterans short of funds to cover college.

As a student veteran my first college I attended didnäó»t not have a lot of resources to assist with my unique and difficult transition. I personally had an overwhelming feeling of being alone. I was use to being surrounded by my brother and sisters in the military. Please understand that the military did an amazing job with transition resources and employment workshops however, I did not realize that the transition from active duty military service to a student veteran would be so hard mental. This makes sense because the people that help with out processing from the military have never experienced being separated from the military. This is merely an assumption. Lucky, I had amazing leadership and training, which allowed me to be resilient while adaptIng to my new environment. I then had the opportunity to transfer to Northeastern University and they have a student veterans organization that has been a huge help with my transition and academic achievements thus far. I want to highlight that there are countless veterans and student veterans that are not seeking these resources available for them. I understood that I needed to be proactive however, not all veterans or student veterans know of these resources. The other day I was speaking with a fellow student veteran and he informed me he dropped all of his classes because they were overwhelming. After speaking with him for several hours he said that the course work was overwhelming due to additional life stresses. When I reflect on this situation I am fearful that myself and other student veterans will experience similar doubts and life stresses. In the military we have standards and Northeastern has standards as well. To this day I am 15-30 mins early before class. I have missed a total of 5 classes over the course of 2 years. The feeling of getting a C on an exam can be overwhelming because we tend to see this as a failure just has much as not being at the place of duty (the classroom) on time. This might not seem like an issue but student veterans are not your average 19 year old student who is only worried about what they are going to do over the semester break. Again just an assumption. Student veterans have school, financial, and family stresses and they typically lost contact with friends and family while in the service. The transition back to school can feel like you are alone with a lot of problems with very few people that can relate. So something as simple as passing your exam with a C can be the breaking point for any student veteran. Thus, the reason a special force veteran dropped his course because he got a C on his midterm exam in Calculus 3 and he felt as if this was not meant for him. I told him there isnäó»t a GPA on your diploma, but I understood his pain because similar thoughts cross my mind. If I could sum up my experience so far in one sentence I would say it feels like I am on a rollercoaster with out any safety restraints and itäó»s so much fun. Sorry for the confusion and thank you for your time.

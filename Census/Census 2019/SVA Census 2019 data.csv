Veterans who have served during the times of different actions, should not be judged as to whether they deployed on that operation or not.  For example, I was stationed in Panama during just cause.  Because I was still stationed there during Desert Storm, I was not deployed to the Middle East.  Between the VA and the different veteran's organizations, I feel like I'm a second-class veteran just because I hadn't been deployed to the Middle East.  I realize that they have different needs, but veterans that honorably performed their duties in other areas during these times deserve the same consideration as to what their needs are as those who deployed.  If my state hadn't offered tuition remission for ALL veterans, there would have been no way that I could have gone to school, because the VA and other organizations wouldn't even give me the time of day because I only participated in Operation Just Cause.",,-3,Army,Veteran,E-5,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1982,1992,,,,,,,,,,,,Panama (Operation Just Cause),,,,Peacetime Service,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

     Veteran students tend to be overlooked and lumped in with other transfer students. Universities do not value the qualities student veterans have which may set them apart from other incoming students. I believe many student veterans are well equipped to excel in universities as they have better time management skills, more dedication to study and complete assignments, more discipline in the classroom, and experience in using critical thinking.

2. DoD fails to insist those non-traditional educational experiences by documented, evaluated and awarded proper credentialing to be accepted by colleges and universities.
3.  Academia generally believes itself to be superior intellectually, morally and with a broadened diversified range of experience; yet truth be known, they are mostly insulated and pampered in a bubble of myopic self-righteousness placed upon a pedestal of their own making and absent of a broad base of experience. In stark contrast to a foundation of experience, like the base of a pyramid built thru a plethora of operational assignments in the Armed Forces. Academia's experience foundations are rather built like an upside down base of experience built upon the apex of the pyramid and only broadened by an indoctrination and complete cultural immersion and adoption of the insulated utopian view of academia which is completely funded by, insulated and immune by the state and federal government.

Working with my Director of Certifying, Melissa Barber, and my Director of Outreach, Dwayne Gordon, we encourage our staff to look for areas that need to be streamlined, through the use of technology and otherwise, and we problem-solve to create and implement solutions for greater efficiency. To provide high-quality, compassionate service to transitioning veterans, and to increase retention, we regularly seek ways to discover best practices in serving veterans used by other universities, and also offer our learnings to other institutions. Part of this effort includes implementing new programs and events, as well as becoming a member of and regularly participating in committees and organizations that strive to help veterans. We proactively seek to provide expanding resources for student veterans by communicating and cooperating with the departments at UNLV and also organizations in the greater Las Vegas community. We continually update our marketing strategy to recruit veterans to enroll at UNLV, including advertisements in military magazines and regular trips to education fairs at military bases.

With that in mind, it is a difficulty to pay back classes we have to drop instantly. Also, the strict amount of months allotted in the GI Bill causes student-vets to put more on their plate than they can handle...which ultimately causes them to have to drop classes or their GPA will suffer. The “dropped class pay back” and the “36 months of benefits” could perhaps be better tailored to produce more graduates. Additionally, the book stipend usually does not cover the full cost of books. That being said, I’m thankful for every bit of it. Also, the summer adds an interesting difficulty. You can either take one class a month, and you get less out of the GI Bill, or take the summer off, and lose a big source of income for 3 months, which is just long enough to be very uncomfortable, but not long enough to commit to a good paying job.

The student veterans have a very ""holier than thou"" mentality when it comes to courses and other students. They regularly have the idea that because they're older and served in the United States Military they are guaranteed to pass a course with doing the smallest amount of work possible in order to make it through, and plan to use that as a ""leverage"" against the professors. They regularly chastise other students because they are younger and have less life experience, instead of attempting to mentor and teach. The student veterans at my campus expect full inclusive treatment from the campus, but rarely put anything towards the betterment of the school. It's a very toxic thought process and I have personally started to shy away from the SVA because of the toxic mentality and behavior.

The whole school and town of Bellingham, WA always had a protest against any military actions, and Student Veterans like myself felt excluded due to the rhetoric of the protests. In addition, the school did not provide and show genuine support to Student Veterans' rights; and the school's Veterans Office was not staffed very well. Fast forward to being a Student Veteran at Syracuse University (SU), I have observe a huge difference of experience. This school is very friendly to Student Veterans and provide a lot of support. My current experience at SU is very positive and would advocate any Veteran to be a student at this institution instead of my undergraduate alma mater.

In 2004 I was hired full time as a Fire Engineer for the City and was able to complete school due to coworkers that would trade hours with me and a understanding supervisor who had been in the Reserves.
Some instructors were very understanding, some were not.  One of the biggest problems was that it was hard to come back from war and deal with the stupidity of college.  The schools idea of something very important was not aligning with what I as a vet considered very important.  It also didn't help that I had not yet been diagnosed or treated for PTSD.
Now I work two days a week (48 hours) as a Fire Engineer and PRN/Part Time as a registered nurse working 12-24 hours a week on average.

Most medical programs that are equivalent to job experience is long and difficult to get into. Example would be Nursing for prior Hospital Corpsman/ Medics have to take a TEAS exam prior to applying to a nursing program. Man Vets like myself have found that we score below average in two categories (reading & language) which prevents us from applying. However we score above the average total score. I know Texas Tech school of nursing has allowed a couple of vets due to this same situation to see how the students will do. The students are in the top of the class and are excelling past other students that scored higher on the TEAS exam. If vets with experience can be exempt from taking this exam a lot more Nursing programs will be flooded with quality students that will excel in the program. Thus elevating the strain that healthcare is facing with the shortage of nurses. ,-2,,Navy,Veteran,E-6,,Some,Very,Very,"Severe	","Severe	","Severe	",Some,A little,Very,Very,Very,"Severe	","Severe	",Some,100%,2000,2016,,,Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) – All Locations,Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF),,"Other War on Terror Operation, not listed",,,,,,,,,,Peacetime Service,,,,,,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When everybody was given tax breaks to hire, Vets were everywhere. Now, there is barely a mention unless it is about PTSD or a death overseas.  Vets have  families, and/or other responsibilities. Schools don't understand that. You can tell them till you are blue in the face, they still want them to participate in everything.  Support starts at a System or school Presidential level. If either or both are non-existent, there seems to be little internal notice of Veterans. Student Vets have issues like everybody else, but then have the added stress of broken VA issues. The education side of the VA was okay. Last year, the VA started going down hill there too. The VA is also making changes that the ELRs don't even know about.  You can still call five different times and get five different answers.  I have personally called the VA, asked to talk to a manager and had the discussion about that.  His answer was basically ""that's the way it is. the new guys have to learn.""   Veteran suicide has to stop.  Is it the cocktail of drugs on deployments? Is it feeling alone after you get out? Is it realizing that nobody cares until someone needs people for a grant to be funded? What seems to work is staying connected. That means face to face time, not locked in a trance on a video game or alone in the country.  It seems like the SVA is now leading the charge on most Vet related issues and getting things done.

1) the rules around multiple eligibility aren’t clear and student vets have been burnt by trying to switch from CH30 MGIB to CH33 Post 9/11. I’ve heard this is an issue from multiple schools across the nation. The VA website is bad about it, Transition classes are bad about it, and it needs fixed.
2) the choice act has gaps for service members on terminal leave that aren’t going to school in a home state or where they are on orders. (Simple fix to just include on terminal leave to the language).
3) SVA needs to weigh in on Tuition Assistance the program is running out of. Only each year and the response from commands is “use your post 9/11 benefits” which seems like a cop out
4) I know y’all are on it, but the transfer of eligibility rules have to be fixed and the 16 year cap definitely needs to be removed. Vets should be able to transfer their benefits forever as well (and some think they can, find out they can’t transfer any benefits, and now a dependent is missing financial support at college.",,,Marine Corps,Veteran,E-3,Yes,Very,Very,"Severe	","Severe	",Very,Very,Very,Very,Very,"Severe	","Severe	",Very,Very,Very,60%,2003,2006,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"None of the above, Not deployed",,Yes,Graduate degree (MA / MS / MBA etc.),,,2013,Over a year,"$100,000 to $109,999",No,Yes,No,"No, never been in default",Serious burden,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Motivation was hard at first, but I persevered. 

It is very lonely as well. It's hard to connect with fellow students who are much younger than you and it's hard to find anyone outside of school. I became very depressed and still struggle with it.

There are also a lot of opportunities or benefits that I was not aware of or missed entirely.

I sincerely appreciate being afforded the opportunity to go to school with no debt. I did graduate and get a job in my degree area, but I was also overlooked by a lot of other hiring companies due to age discrimination or over qualification in leadership. I had to accept one with a salary far below the standard for my field. As a result, I live paycheck to paycheck with a bachelor's degree in a computer science related program.

Belonging to SVA and my university's veteran's organization was great and I am still completing a certification program that I was eligible for through SVA.

My school does not have a VRC. We need a policy to require more Summer class flexibility from both schools and the VA. I had to take an incomplete over the Summer because I've been struggling with anxiety, but until I finish that class - there is no way to have the VA arrange payment for that class, and I can't pay out of my pocket. I applied for Voc Rehab as soon as my rating was finalized, nearly 6 months ago in Hope's of finding a program that can help me earn my PhD despite my traumatic brain injury and other mental health issues. Even then, there is no certainty the VA will have any reasonable process to help me. If I could have dropped the class or taken a lighter load from the beginning while remaining financially stable, I would have done so.

I would also like to see work-study positions available within Congressional District Offices to help Veterans with their benefits and give Veterans, like me, who seek careers in public policy, a better chance to receive paid job experience to worry about the bills less when seeking experience. Further, the ration of Veterans serving as Congressional staff-members is dismal, and most elected members are Pre-9/11 servicemembers.

During the transition it is imperative they can become part of a community near them which can benefit their needs as an individual. This will allow for each individual to understand their actual needs and how they can make decisions based on the support of appropriate social groups to increase their perspective in what their core values and strengths are as new civilian contributing members to society. 

As a student veteran I have a drive that makes me continue to grow and learn because that’s what I learned in the United States Marine Corps. The foundation that was created during that time is now what allows me to manage myself and my personal endeavors in a balanced sense. When I pursued being part of the Pat Tillman Veteran Scholar Program, I looked for a way to become more involved in my community, how I can learn from others who are being successful in their fields! It was amazing to find all the great leaders who surrounded me and those who were also pursuing to be part of that success! 

The Excellence Mindset we have as leaders needs to continue to be refined for ourselves and those who will continue to serve our fantastic country and showing them support and community involvement is the most important because that’s what we are removed from in our transition. 

When I hear the following analogy, it resonated with me because I was not aware how much of an impact my fellow family in arms made a change for my life.

I volunteered as the Veterans Club President at CC. I am aware of the struggles of numerous Veterans; not only my own. To include varying levels and stages of pushback from the VA and Education system. I have advocated at the CC and University levels for Student Veterans and their Student Families as well.
Knowing of and Experiencing the issues between the VA and the Educations system first hand, I forced myself to find alternative solutions to obtaining higher education. 
Struggling to manage my finances, the requirements of the VA and the Lack of collaboration, communication and cooperation between the VA and Education systems, leaving me and other Veterans in an endless loop of stress and financial hardships was enough for me to resolve on my own what the systems could not and would not. The VA VocRehab put my GIBILL in Jeopardy and it expired unbeknownst to me until checked on it. The VocRehab system failed me and stressed me even more. They made promises of employment, education and security that in one swift moment they denied me. However, by that time, I had made alternative choices and regained my sanity and drive for education (as best as I could : ) ). At this point I am still struggling but this time its self inflicted and involves only my ability to stay focused. I work two jobs and have survived bankruptcy, my home is under foreclosure but I am remaining positive that I am overcoming all that I went through.

So, when they return to a Junior College or 4 year institution they are waiting GI Bill on classes that do not count for credit (i.e. predatory English & math classes). The other issue is when a veteran does attend a JC and goes to transfer some classes do not count at the 4 year institutions, once again putting the veterans short of funds to cover college. The extension of the STEM majors to 5 years should be looked at for all veterans, to cover the predatory classes and allow them to finish their degree with out the burden of stress in their last year of school.

As a student veteran my first college I attended didn’t not have a lot of resources to assist with my unique and difficult transition. I personally had an overwhelming feeling of being alone. I was use to being surrounded by my brother and sisters in the military. Please understand that the military did an amazing job with transition resources and employment workshops however, I did not realize that the transition from active duty military service to a student veteran would be so hard mental. This makes sense because the people that help with out processing from the military have never experienced being separated from the military. This is merely an assumption. Lucky, I had amazing leadership and training, which allowed me to be resilient while adaptIng to my new environment. I then had the opportunity to transfer to Northeastern University and they have a student veterans organization that has been a huge help with my transition and academic achievements thus far. I want to highlight that there are countless veterans and student veterans that are not seeking these resources available for them. I understood that I needed to be proactive however, not all veterans or student veterans know of these resources. The other day I was speaking with a fellow student veteran and he informed me he dropped all of his classes because they were overwhelming. After speaking with him for several hours he said that the course work was overwhelming due to additional life stresses. When I reflect on this situation I am fearful that myself and other student veterans will experience similar doubts and life stresses. In the military we have standards and Northeastern has standards as well. To this day I am 15-30 mins early before class. I have missed a total of 5 classes over the course of 2 years. The feeling of getting a C on an exam can be overwhelming because we tend to see this as a failure just has much as not being at the place of duty (the classroom) on time. This might not seem like an issue but student veterans are not your average 19 year old student who is only worried about what they are going to do over the semester break. Again just an assumption. Student veterans have school, financial, and family stresses and they typically lost contact with friends and family while in the service. The transition back to school can feel like you are alone with a lot of problems with very few people that can relate. So something as simple as passing your exam with a C can be the breaking point for any student veteran. Thus, the reason a special force veteran dropped his course because he got a C on his midterm exam in Calculus 3 and he felt as if this was not meant for him. I told him there isn’t a GPA on your diploma, but I understood his pain because similar thoughts cross my mind. If I could sum up my experience so far in one sentence I would say it feels like I am on a rollercoaster with out any safety restraints and it’s so much fun.

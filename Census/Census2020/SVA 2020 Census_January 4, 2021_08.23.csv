I received my GED in 1986 at Camp Casey Korea, and I didn't start my college career until 21 years later. I know have 3 degrees inclding my MBA. My transition into acedemia was tough and I wish that I had known more about what portunities were available to me. 

Now I work at a private university supporting veterans and their families but I struggle to get them to come to me. I could share so much of what I have learned, I could make their lives so much better than mine if they would reach out, but they hardly ever do. I try to think back and ask myself; what would have brought you to the table with you. And I don't know what to say. For me, it was a friend who got me started on my journey. But I am not their friend and I cannot  figure out how to get acquainted with them to possibly become a friend. Especially in this time of Covid-19. 

Anyway, my academic career was rough, but I enjoyed it. I landed some amazing jobs like with the US Forest Service, and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. I resigned to come back to my almamater because at the time Sequestration wasn't allowing me a chance at a full time position. I was on 13 month contracts and I was tired of wondering every Christmas, should I be spending money on gifts, or saving for January when I am unemployed? 

During my academic career and new staff career I was actively engaged in many things such as: Society of American Foresters (SAF) Association of the United States Army (AUSA) I was even a chapter president,  VFW, American Legion, I was on the Washington State Military Transition Council Higher Education Working Group, I attended Chamber of Commerce events, Washington Department of Veterans Affairs events, and a lot more. 

Now I am still working but looking for a new job because I am worried that my school will let me go to stay afloat. I am so blessed, I cannot complain. The transition continues.

The student veterans' resource at my university have been very timely/responsive.  I would like to share some thoughts: 1.  Online programs have obviously grown/becoming more of the norm - why is it that the housing allowance is different for on-site programs vice on-line?  Either way you need a place to live.  2.  My current program, at certain points, will only allow a student to take courses that equate to part-time student status; this is beyond the student's control - yet again impacting the housing allowance - we still have to pay rent/mortgage. Final note - intent (hopefully for most) is to be a contributing member to society, the better the employment the more taxes we pay the more we support our country; so why do my 2 points above, & I am sure there are other nuances, exist?

Unrelated to experiences, but still relevant, I think it might be beneficial to allow individuals that participate in SVA surveys to select more than one option for military affiliation if possible. I recognize this could potentially skew data and might be challenging to logistically execute, but I think it might give students like myself that have more than one affiliation the opportunity to be fully represented. Although I am a Reservist currently, prior to that I served 11 years active duty and then had several months of separation before I joined the Reserves. I am also the spouse of an active duty submariner. So, normally I identify as a Veteran, a Reservist, and a Military Spouse when given the option.

Then I finally sought out higher education and was accepted to a university. This transition to university was not smooth to say the least. I went from full time job to full time school so that I would get the maximum benefits financially and not really have to work while in school. I had to drop all of my classes midway through because I was not able to keep up with classes of ready for the course load.

The education I have received from public institutions is worse than what I received from the military.  Faculty have already proven how little they care about students, yet they are being paid by students.  The only thing being taught now days is sacrifice.  You have to spend money to make money.  We all know we have to work hard to see results, but why make the work harder on us??? I was taught in the military to work smarter and not harder... Increasing the value of education only makes it harder to graduate and decreasing the value only lowers our education.  Schools have become businesses that care more about the curriculum and profit rather than if the students are comprehending what is being taught.  Everything comes with a cost, what are we willing to pay for something that is free?  It doesn't leave a good impression on people to make them pay to better themselves.

I had my wife, who did not work at the time, and two children at home while attending classes and working a full-time job. Then, unfortunately, my time in service got in the way of the future I envisioned the education I was working would provide. When I could not get any assistance with my issues from the VA at the time, I dropped out of school and focused on keeping my family fed. Back then, there was nothing in the way of what I see and have experienced today. 

As a student today, there is much available to students. However, as a very non-traditional student being mid-career aged, at a public university, I find myself out of sorts with the college experience. I think that it is probably proper in many respects; it is not like someone of my age should be joining a frat for example.  It many ways, because the education system is designed around the young and inexperienced, I feel out of place.  Likely a symptom that my peers are generally younger than my children with a few exceptions. My life experience also gets in the way of the general instruction methods of the professors as it is also designed around the inexperienced. I hear similar things from the veterans that are younger also, so it leads me to believe that the experiences veterans have are the reason over age, although it is compounded I believe when one has reached the point of middle-age. Additionally, the resources are not designed or dedicated to an aged student. For example, when looking into grants, many are unavailable to me because of age. Yet the affordability of education is compounded by being established in life, with less working years ahead of me than behind me, a house, cars, and the rest of the bills that most working adults have. 

So in general, I feel options and opportunities are more limited to an aged student.",(5),,Army,Veteran,E-4,Yes,Very,Very,Some,Some,Very,Some,None,"Severe	","Severe	",Some,Some,Very,Very,None,100%,1989,1992,Persian Gulf War I (Operation Desert Shield / Storm),,Yes,Kirk,Williams,z1891800@students.niu.edu,3128828281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a professor lets their personal political beliefs interfere with the education of others, it creates the lackadaisical behavior by the younger generations. 

This is why I've chosen to return to my degree work online to eliminate the in class settings of politically ran classrooms (which I've experienced in a couple of on campus courses).

I applied for 2 year and talked to over 600+ different mentors to prepare me. It has caused my depression to get worse and worse and I’m afraid of telling my own psychologist that it makes me think about suicide daily. My friends and family don’t even know this about me. I’m tired of my skills not being recognized for the hard work I put in. All I want is a chance at life. If anyone seriously wants the veteran suicide rate go down and this even includes the stress that students veterans are constantly under, give them a chance. We that choose to go college after our service look for more, but all we receive is the same or less as other traditional students. My grades were significantly affected by the lack of support from companies to let me assist in an internship because I spent an average of 4 hours a day just looking and applying for internships. I would say I’m not as upset as I am disappointed. This takes a lot for me to say because I spent night after night crying about it and it has negatively my love life, personal life, dating life, social life, and my family life. This is why I went to grad school because I’m tired of not being enough. I have a goal for my future and I just want to help other veterans succeed like I’m going to do. If anyone has any questions about this, call me personally because I’m ready to have the conversation.

We are not married. However, we are technically domestic partners through her work, so I can get on her health insurance. We file taxes separately. She does not claim  and has never claimed me as a dependent, but she does claim both girls. She files as head of household. 
 My total time in National Guard was Illinois Army National Guard, infantry unit, from 1986-1993. I then joined the Wisconsin Air National Guard from 1993-2007. 
 For part of my Guard time, from 1 October 2001 - 31 August 2002, I was on a Title 10 active duty tour home station in support of Operation Noble Eagle, post 9/11. I also did an AD short tour from about 31 May 2002 - 15 July 2002 in support of Operation Southern Watch, Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia. 
 I earned my J.D. from Northern Illinois University in 1991. I did have student loan debt from law school, which has long since been paid off. Part of my student loan debt was repaid through the Student Loan Repayment Program (SLRP) for being in a critical skill MOS (infantry) in the IL ARNG. 
 Most recently, I earned a associate's degree in Child Development from LA Harbor College, using my Post 9/11 GI Bill for part of that time. I earned the A.D. in spring 2019. 
 Right now, since fall 2018, I have been working as a Special Education Assistant, helping students with special needs at a Career & Transition Center through LA Unified School District. 
 Hope that all sort of explains my situation, which might have gotten lost in some of the survey questions. 
 I am working toward a program to become a certified special education teacher with LAUSD.

I hated being around these happy-go-lucky civilian college students so much, I'd drink every single day prior to the first class and would run home to keep drinking before my next class. Daytime college students just annoyed the shit out of me and I was constantly fantasizing reaching for a knife on my person and shoving it into their throats. At this time, I lived with my hanai mom and, with her helplessly seeing me going down this negative spiral, she threatened to have me committed because it hurt her so much to watch me fall into despair. My grades eventually fell and I had to take a break from school to focus on coming back from whatever emotional hellhole I'd unknowingly crawled into. I started seeing a psychiatrist, got a little better, and when I was ready to do school again, decided to switch universities and enter their night program instead. This time, things were much better. I kept my grades up and was able to graduate with a BA on the honor roll.

One thing that I will say is as a TWO-TIME HONORABLY DISCHARGED VETERAN of both the US Air Force and U.S. Navy; there is no way in hell that I or any other veteran should have to pay for our education. Why was I NEVER afforded educational benefits after my discharge from the Navy?  I tell you why; because the yeoman at my last duty station aboard the USS Sierra AD-18 out of Charleston, So. Carolina, had me and other sailors sign certain papers that took our educational benefits away in exchange for cash at discharge. 

Stupid me, I spent 3 years on a ship that was welded to the pier that never went anywhere. Until my last year of enlistment the powers that be decided to send our old tin bucket of a destroyer-tender on a 6-month deployment (IO/Med Cruise).  When we got back to our home port it was 2 days before Christmas 1982.  My finance and our 4 month old son was waiting on the pier when we moored.  All I could think of was liberty call after a 6 month deployment and my new son and soon to be wife and making money. So after the holidays the paperwork started for my discharge. It was at that time the yeoman gave me thousand of dollars; which was a culmination of all pay due me and money I had taken from each paycheck for my educational needs once out of the Navy.  However, I was so excited to be getting out after 4 years of service; knowing I also served in the US Air Force prior to serving in the Navy.  All I wanted to do was start my family and get on with my civilian life.  

There should NEVER be any condition or situation where any veteran has to borrow money and take out both subsidized and unsubsidized loans to pay for his/her college education. We paid our debt to society be serving our country. We the veterans of the country make up less than 2% of ALL people in the US. who have served in the military.  If anyone deserves a break on education, healthcare, housing, and employment it should be my fellow veterans and me.  We did what 98% of the country refused to do or could not do.  However, me and my fellow veterans DID SERVE. 

Now the SVA and other veteran-based groups and associations need to do something for me and other veterans who have been bamboozled by our own government leaders (e.g., ship commanders; post commanders, recruiters, etc....); and that is to right any wrongs that have befallen my fellow veterans as it relates to educational benefits and any other needs they may have.
